# Threadlight — Pilot Pipeline Skills

> **Eleven pipeline skills + one orchestrator (12 total)** that take a customer
> engagement from a one-paragraph brief through to a deployed, evaluated,
> observable, **production-ready** Microsoft Foundry hosted agent — runnable
> on the customer's tenant in a single working session, then handed off to
> the production track without ending up in lab graveyard.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| [`threadlight-design`](skills/threadlight-design/) | Produces SPEC.md, demo deck, prep guide, experience page from a brief |
| [`threadlight-local-test`](skills/threadlight-local-test/) | Boots the agent locally for rapid iteration (Pattern 0 quickstart) |
| [`threadlight-deploy`](skills/threadlight-deploy/) | 7-phase `azd up` orchestration — ACR, Bicep, hooks, Foundry, Citadel |
| [`threadlight-safe-check`](skills/threadlight-safe-check/) | Pre/post-deploy gate — validates every resource selector before go-live |
| [`threadlight-demo-data-factory`](skills/threadlight-demo-data-factory/) | Generates industry-realistic seed data for demos |
| [`threadlight-event-triggers`](skills/threadlight-event-triggers/) | Wires ACA Jobs, Event Grid, and cron receivers into the deploy lifecycle |
| [`threadlight-hitl-patterns`](skills/threadlight-hitl-patterns/) | Human-in-the-loop gates via Teams Adaptive Cards + audit trail |
| [`threadlight-workspace-ui`](skills/threadlight-workspace-ui/) | Operator dashboard (React workspace) behind Easy Auth |
| [`threadlight-consumption-iq`](skills/threadlight-consumption-iq/) | **NEW v0.1.0-alpha** — post-deploy Azure cost projection + SKU-diff recommender. Walks Bicep + `azd env`, reads SPEC § 12 `load_profile{}` (wizard writes it if absent), hits Azure Retail Prices for current SKUs + 2–3 alternatives per resource (AOAI, Foundry, ACA, Cosmos, Storage, APIM, AI Search), emits `docs/cost-projection.md` + `specs/cost-manifest.json`. Soft-advisory; consumed by `production-ready`'s tightened COST-005 + new COST-006. |
| [`threadlight-production-ready`](skills/threadlight-production-ready/) | **v0.3.0** — advisory production-readiness scorecard (BicepGraph parser, 13 pillars, Defender / Policy / quota / restore-drill checks, `--gate-preview`, `--diff`, `--remediate`, `--trend-csv`, OIDC CI). Hard dep on `bicep` CLI; no regex fallback. |
| [`threadlight-cicd`](skills/threadlight-cicd/) | **NEW v0.1.0** — production deploy pipeline + env-setup runbooks for locked-down customer envs (no direct `azd up`). Onboarding-path gate (standalone / spoke-onboard / hub-deploy-then-spoke), then generates **GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps** OIDC/WIF pipelines + UAMI/federated-credential, least-privilege RBAC, and private-VNet runner runbooks. Secret-free; ships a `central-platform-boundary.md` that keeps the pilot pipeline **separate** from `citadel-hub-deploy`. |
| [`threadlight-auto`](skills/threadlight-auto/) | **Orchestrator** — wraps the 10 pipeline skills behind one freeform prompt; resumes from `.threadlight/auto-state.json`; smart-recovers quota/RBAC/ImagePull failures |

## Pipeline flow

```
threadlight-design → threadlight-local-test → threadlight-deploy →
threadlight-safe-check (gate) → threadlight-consumption-iq (cost) →
foundry-evals + foundry-observability →
threadlight-production-ready (advisory) → customer architecture review →
threadlight-cicd (prod deploy pipeline, when the customer env is locked down)
```

The 10-stage pipeline above is the spine. `threadlight-auto` drives the same
chain end-to-end when you want one-prompt automation (demos, resumption,
template-from-scenario kickoffs). **`threadlight-cicd` is a manual handoff
step** after the readiness gate — `threadlight-auto` does **not** drive it
(auto is a pilot driver, not a prod-pipeline orchestrator). It runs on a
**separate repo/pipeline** from central-platform deployment (`citadel-hub-deploy`).

The full technical briefing is in [`THREADLIGHT.md`](THREADLIGHT.md).

## Starting from a Kratos export

Threadlight skills also compose on a **Kratos-exported agent project**. An SE
can run the Kratos `Agent Manager → Deploy tab` export, `azd up` the bundle, then
layer in Threadlight production-hardening — no rewrite, additive to the
`threadlight-design` flow above.

```bash
unzip <use-case>-foundry-agent.zip && cd <use-case>-agent
azd auth login
azd up -e <use-case>-prod
```

Then invoke, in order: `threadlight-safe-check` → `threadlight-deploy`
(Kratos-export mode: enrich/validate + backfill `evals/`) → `foundry-evals` →
`threadlight-consumption-iq` → `threadlight-production-ready`, plus on-demand
`threadlight-hitl-patterns` / `threadlight-event-triggers` /
`threadlight-workspace-ui`. The canonical reference — detection signal,
skills-root convention, what's intentionally trimmed, and the full invocation
order — is in [`docs/KRATOS-BRIDGE.md`](docs/KRATOS-BRIDGE.md).

## Install

### As a plugin (recommended)

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add aiappsgbb/threadlight-skills
copilot plugin install threadlight-skills@threadlight-skills
```

### Individual skills

```bash
gh skill install aiappsgbb/threadlight-skills threadlight-design
gh skill install aiappsgbb/threadlight-skills threadlight-deploy
# ... etc
```

### Companion skills (in awesome-gbb)

Threadlight skills cross-reference foundry-*, azd-patterns, citadel-*, and
other skills from [awesome-gbb](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb).
Install both plugins for the full pipeline:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb
copilot plugin install awesome-gbb@awesome-gbb

copilot plugin marketplace add aiappsgbb/threadlight-skills
copilot plugin install threadlight-skills@threadlight-skills
```

## Live experience
