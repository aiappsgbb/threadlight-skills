    Wrapper around the GitHub Copilot SDK + azure-ai-agentserver-invocations
    stack, on the GA unified `azure.yaml` hosted-agent deploy shape shared
    with `threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf`. Version-pinned via PyPI; no git SHA
    tracking for the packages themselves, but the deploy-model migration in
    this pin is grounded against two upstream sources with pinned commits:

    - microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples commit
      `22b2c89c676bddb107ea370330d6341e25ff674b` —
      `samples/python/hosted-agents/bring-your-own/invocations/github-copilot`
      is the official Microsoft sample for this exact SDK + protocol
      combination. Its `azure.yaml` confirms `requiredVersions.extensions.
      azure.ai.agents: '>=1.0.0-beta.4'`, `protocols: [{protocol:
      invocations, version: 2.0.0}]`, and `infra.provider: microsoft.foundry`.
      Its `main.py` confirms the GA public import surface:
      `from copilot import CopilotClient, PermissionHandler, ProviderConfig`
      and `from copilot.session_events import SessionEventType`.
    - Azure/azure-dev — three merged PRs retire the pre-GA known issues this
      pin used to carry:
      - PR #8941 (merge commit `19c231956388941ace7dbe3f697617198d25dff3`,
        merged 2026-07-03) — stops the `azure.ai.agents` extension from
        assigning a role to the per-agent managed identity after deploy;
        Foundry now grants the identity's required permissions internally.
        Retires KI-001.
      - PR #8866 (merge commit `a4cf4a909479583693e1b185d0a784e02068e885`,
        merged 2026-07-06) — removes `Foundry-Features: *=V1Preview`
        headers for GA; the endpoint API version literal is now `v1`.
        Retires the V1Preview-header prose that used to accompany KI-002.
      - PR #8981 (merge commit `635b011eebbf47c1efa59b37c7f08023b5ee8a54`,
        merged 2026-07-06) — wires the container registry automatically for
        `azd ai agent init -m <azure.yaml> --deploy-mode container` on an
        adopted (brownfield) project. Retires KI-003/KI-004's manual
        `services:`/`AZURE_TENANT_ID` wiring — the unified single-file
        `azure.yaml` plus guided init supersede both.

    Reference audit commit for this migration pass: Azure/azure-dev
    `9efebd953104414cf58eb78098729519b184bb6b` was supplied as the
    citation anchor for the beta.3/beta.5 GA-split behavior described
    above; the three PRs (#8941, #8866, #8981) are the specific merged
    changes that retire KI-001 through KI-004 and are cited by their own
    merge-commit SHAs for precision.

    KI-002's original claim ("`azd ai agent invoke` does not wrap user
    input") does not reproduce against the current GA CLI (`azd ai agent
    invoke <name> '{"input": "..."}' --protocol invocations` sends the
    literal JSON body positionally, matching the official README's
    documented usage) — retired as a pre-GA-only defect, not carried
    forward.

# Upstream pin — `threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/ghcp` skill

This Tier-B pin captures the PyPI package stack for the GitHub Copilot SDK
hosted-agent wrapper (BYOK + Invocations protocol), now on the GA unified
`azure.yaml` deploy shape.

## Why pinned

The skill wraps two preview PyPI packages whose release cadences are not
coordinated:

- `github-copilot-sdk` — `1.0.1` is the current **GA** release; the 0.3.x
  series and the 1.0.0b1-b4 prereleases are superseded. The `~=1.0.0` cap
  covers PATCH bumps inside 1.0.x. Breaking changes vs 0.3.x: removed
  `SubprocessConfig` wrapper class, removed `auto_start` kwarg on
  `CopilotClient.__init__` (see KI-006). Existing skill code using
  `CopilotClient(SubprocessConfig(...), auto_start=False)` was updated to
  the flat `CopilotClient(github_token=...)` shape. Public import surface
  matches the official Microsoft sample:
  `from copilot import CopilotClient, PermissionHandler, ProviderConfig` +
  `from copilot.session_events import SessionEventType` (not the previous
  `copilot.session` / `copilot.generated.session_events` submodule paths).
- `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` — `1.0.0b6` is the latest public
  beta (no GA release yet); pinned exact (`==`) because the cap pattern
  doesn't apply across pre-release boundaries. Matches the official
  sample's `requirements.txt` (`azure-ai-agentserver-invocations==1.0.0b6`).
- `azure-ai-agentserver-core` — transitive dep of `-invocations`, which
  declares `azure-ai-agentserver-core>=2.0.0b7` (UNBOUNDED-UPPER). The
  reference `pyproject.toml` now pins it EXACT (`==2.0.0b7`) so a future
  core `b8+` that renames a symbol cannot silently break fresh container
  builds. Grounded 2026-07-04: a stale `invocations b4 + core b7` probe
  crash-looped with `ImportError: cannot import name 'CHAT_ISOLATION_KEY'`
  (HTTP 424 before body-parse); the current `b6 + b7` combo is proven
  healthy live.

## GA deploy-model migration (v2.0.0, this refresh)

This refresh retires the skill's entire pre-GA deploy model in favor of the
same unified single-file `azure.yaml` (services graph, `azd ai agent init`
guided path + direct-copy brownfield path, bicep-less
`infra.provider: microsoft.foundry`) that `threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf` uses,
adapted for `language: docker` + the Invocations protocol instead of MAF's
Responses protocol. The old two-file `agent.yaml` + hand-wired `azure.yaml`
contract, the `remoteBuild`/manual `services:` wiring, the
`AZURE_TENANT_ID` postdeploy-hook requirement, and the manual account-scope
`Foundry User` role grant are all removed — see SKILL.md § "azure.yaml
(unified GA deployment)" and § "Identity & RBAC for hosted agents".

**KI-001, KI-002, KI-003, and KI-004 are retired, not merely closed:**

- **KI-001** (manual account-scope `Foundry User` grant for the per-agent
  identity) — retired by Azure/azure-dev PR #8941
  (`19c231956388941ace7dbe3f697617198d25dff3`, merged 2026-07-03): the
  `azure.ai.agents` extension no longer assigns a role to the per-agent
  managed identity after deploy at all — Foundry grants the identity's
  required permissions internally. There is nothing left to work around.

  **RBAC correction (v2.0.9):** PR #8941 and the upstream echo-agent
  sample it was validated against never exercise a real model call — the
  echo agent returns its input without ever authenticating to the model
  data plane. Controlled Azure tests proved that a hosted agent doing
  **real model inference** still requires the per-version **instance**
  managed identity to hold `Foundry User`
  (`53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d`) at BOTH the Foundry account
  scope AND the Foundry project scope; project-only and account-only both
  returned HTTP 401, and only the dual-scope grant succeeded. The
  successful model-inference run had zero explicit blueprint assignments,
  so the blueprint identity needs no explicit role for this inference
  path; only the instance identity requires the dual-scope grant. The
  skill and fixture
  now document and perform the dual-scope instance grant before invocation
  (SKILL.md § "Identity & RBAC for hosted agents", Step 3.5 of the
  fixture). This is not a re-opening of KI-001's *deploy-time* auto-grant
  (still retired); it is a distinct, previously-undocumented
  model-inference prerequisite.
- **KI-002** (`azd ai agent invoke` allegedly not wrapping user input in
  `{"input": "..."}`) — did not reproduce against the current GA CLI. The
  official sample's README documents `azd ai agent invoke '{"input": "..."}'`
  as the primary invocation path, and a local `azure.ai.agents`
  `1.0.0-beta.4` CLI's `--help` confirms `azd ai agent invoke [name]
  [message] --protocol invocations --output raw --timeout <seconds>` sends
  the literal positional message. Retired as a pre-GA-only defect.
- **KI-003** (`azd ai agent init` not adding a `services:` block) and
  **KI-004** (`AZURE_TENANT_ID` required before `azd deploy`) — retired by
  the unified single-file `azure.yaml` contract itself (no more separate
  manifest to hand-wire a `services:` block into) plus Azure/azure-dev
  PR #8981 (`635b011eebbf47c1efa59b37c7f08023b5ee8a54`, merged 2026-07-06),
  which wires the container registry automatically for
  `azd ai agent init -m <azure.yaml> --deploy-mode container` on an
  existing (brownfield) project.

KI-005 (provider shape decision matrix) and KI-006 (`SubprocessConfig`
removal) are unaffected by the deploy-model migration and remain open /
documented as before.

## Last validation

`2026-08-05` (copilot-bot) — **instance-RBAC model-inference correction
(v2.0.9).** Controlled Azure tests established the minimum working contract
for real model inference by a hosted agent: grant the per-version
**instance** managed identity (not the blueprint identity) the `Foundry
User` role (`53ca6127-db72-4b80-b1b0-d745d6d5456d`) at BOTH the Foundry
account scope AND the Foundry project scope before invocation. Project-only
failed (401), account-only failed (401), both together succeeded. A valid
dual-scope invocation may emit an initial 401 before an internal retry
succeeds, so validation inspects the full event stream rather than aborting
on the first transient event. The earlier "no agent role grant needed"
claim derived from an upstream echo-agent sample that never called a model;
it silently 401'd on live inference. No package pins, SHAs, or
`known_issues_count` changed in this correction — only the RBAC contract
prose (this file), SKILL.md § "Identity & RBAC for hosted agents", and the
fixture's grant/revoke steps. Do NOT add `transient_auth_error` (or any
authorization token) to the workflow retry classifier: this was a
persistent authorization regression, not a transient. Live GHCP T3 evidence
is tracked via the skill's `test-fixture/consumer_prompt.md` matrix leg.

`2026-07-14` (copilot-bot) — GA deploy-model migration re-grounded against
two upstream sources: microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples commit
`22b2c89c676bddb107ea370330d6341e25ff674b` (the official sample's
`azure.yaml` + `main.py` confirm the unified single-file services-graph
shape and the GA `copilot` package import surface) and Azure/azure-dev
PRs #8941, #8866, #8981 (confirmed merged via the GitHub API, with the
merge-commit SHAs cited above). `references/container.py` imports updated
to the GA public surface
(`from copilot import CopilotClient, PermissionHandler, ProviderConfig` +
`from copilot.session_events import SessionEventType`) and verified against
a locally installed `github-copilot-sdk==1.0.1` venv. `references/agent.yaml`
deleted; `references/yaml/azure.yaml` added as the new canonical single-file
deploy manifest, byte-verified against the unified-shape assertions in
`scripts/tests/test_ghcp_hosted_agents_ga_contract.py`. Package version pins
(`github-copilot-sdk`, `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations`,
`azure-ai-agentserver-core`, `azure-identity`, `python-dotenv`) are
unchanged from the prior `2026-07-04` validation — only the deploy model
and known-issue set changed in this refresh. Live Azure E2E evidence for
this refresh is tracked separately via the skill's
`test-fixture/consumer_prompt.md` in CI (see AGENTS.md § 2.9); this pin
file records the package/API-surface grounding, not the CI run itself.

Prior validations:

`2026-07-04` (maintainer) — live re-grounding on a real Foundry deploy at
`azure.ai.agents` ext `1.0.0-beta.4`: rebuilt the container on the skill's
exact pins (`invocations b6` + `core b7`), confirmed the container is 100%
healthy on the then-current pre-GA deploy model.

`2026-06-10` (maintainer) — `github-copilot-sdk==1.0.1` adversarially diff'd
against `0.3.0` API surface on a clean Python 3.14 venv; every import in
`container.py` re-verified; `CopilotClient(github_token=...)` and
`CopilotClient()` constructors instantiated without error; KI-006
regression added to `validation.script` to assert `SubprocessConfig`
remains gone on future pins.

`2026-05-17` (maintainer) — original end-to-end validation on a Foundry test
project, on the pre-GA two-file deploy model this refresh retires.
