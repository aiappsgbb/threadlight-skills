# Private Hosted BASIC: existing project and registry

This opt-in consumer runs one **no-tools** Hosted container and one plain model
request. It is not the public CI fixture, a private prompt-agent threads/runs
test, or governed business execution. Operator approval is required for each
write/invocation, within its original scope and expiry. A setup gate is neither
approval nor a live result. Preserve all existing resources, versions and logs.

## Native contracts and the confirmed defect

- [Official container precheck](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHub-Copilot-for-Azure/blob/91b451609306a490e84854c7c2c1fd79c62398a4/plugins/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry/foundry-agent/deploy/references/container-deploy.md):
  an existing ACR needs a **project ContainerRegistry connection**, independently
  of capability hosts, `AcrPull`, ACR environment variables or BYO-store arrays.
- [Native ACR connection emission](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/2850298a3f0d9f296a4f5795b593a69115fe5b05/cli/azd/extensions/azure.ai.agents/internal/synthesis/templates/modules/foundry-project.bicep):
  `ManagedIdentity`, bare registry `loginServer`, `metadata.ResourceId` = registry
  ARM ID. In this native registry-specific contract, **credentials.clientId is
  the project's principalId** (despite the field name), and
  `credentials.resourceId` is the registry ID. Do not substitute an agent MI or
  infer an Entra application client ID from the field name.
- [Native deploy-only workflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/publishing-workflows#scenario-build-once-deploy-everywhere):
  `azd deploy "$AGENT" --from-package "$IMAGE" --no-prompt` supplies an existing
  remote container image in the documented deploy-only workflow. Keep the same
  immutable service-level `image` and `docker.imagePassthrough: true`.
  `remoteBuild: false` explicitly disables remote builds; never enable it with
  passthrough. Do not rely on YAML passthrough alone. **azd 1.27.0 is not
  supported for this private prebuilt route**, even with `--from-package`;
  see the exact core/extension compatibility gate below. This is **not**
  `azd publish --from-package`, which takes a local package and pushes it.
  The [installed beta.14 target](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/eaa8a9746d2b371e2af09af9d6d0aa4ad57348eb/cli/azd/extensions/azure.ai.agents/internal/project/service_target_agent.go)
  consumes the remote container artifact's `Location` in `deployHostedAgent`
  without rewriting the digest.
- [Official Responses BASIC runtime](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/blob/1abe346cbb2428fce504970498bafecf3803f29c/samples/python/hosted-agents/agent-framework/responses/01-basic/src/agent-framework-agent-basic-responses/main.py):
  `Agent` + `FoundryChatClient` + `ResponsesHostServer`, no tools, `store: False`.
  Its adjacent `azure.yaml` defaults to preview **code** mode. Our stager
  explicitly chooses **container** mode, reuses the catalog dependency cohort
  and never adds a placeholder tool, skill provider or consent bootstrap.

The published setup omission was confirmed in #499. Adding the connection
fixed that prerequisite, **not the entire failed deployment**. An exact copied
BASIC image subsequently activated privately and returned a model response.
Those were different whole artifacts; image contents and propagation/timing were
not isolated. Neither an OCI-only cause nor a Microsoft SDK/backend defect is
proven. No blanket OCI ban is justified. Historical BASIC evidence with an
unused local tool is not fresh evidence for this no-tools consumer.

## 1. Context and credential-free connection inspection

Follow [threadlight-tenant-isolation](../../../../../threadlight-tenant-isolation/SKILL.md) before
**every** operator shell: both existing `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` and `AZD_CONFIG_DIR`,
then exact tenant/subscription assertion immediately before any write.
Use the environment owner's already-approved auth and private operator route.
Never log in or switch global defaults automatically.

Retain `azd version --output json` and the installed extension's local
`$AZD_CONFIG_DIR/extensions/azure.ai.agents/extension.yaml` privately. This
procedure's live-validated compatibility baseline is **azd 1.34.1 +
azure.ai.agents 1.0.0-beta.14**, not a minimum-version claim. Use only an
owner-approved official binary from the
[1.34.1 release](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.34.1);
verify its published asset checksum and put its directory first on this shell's
`PATH`, inherited by the native helpers. Do not update the global installation.
Require `azd.version` = `1.34.1`, extension `version` = `1.0.0-beta.14` and its
declared `requiredAzdVersion` = `>=1.32.0`. A different pair requires explicit
compatibility review, not an automatic upgrade or acceptance because its number
is newer. Verify that `azd deploy --help` supports `--from-package`.
Use the explicit deploy-only command below; do not run package/publish to test
a prebuilt deployment. If the command still attempts a build or push, stop and
reconcile native object existence before any retry; do not repair the Dockerfile
or silently rebuild.

**Core/extension compatibility gate:** the
[1.27.0 execution graph](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/azure-dev-cli_1.27.0/cli/azd/internal/cmd/service_graph.go)
wraps `--from-package` as a local package artifact and still invokes Publish.
The [1.27.0 container publisher](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/azure-dev-cli_1.27.0/cli/azd/pkg/project/container_helper.go)
does not implement `imagePassthrough`; with the required registry environment
binding it enters tag/login/push. The beta.14 target's prebuilt fast path needs
artifact metadata that this core's `--from-package` wrapper does not supply.
Therefore flag availability alone is **not** a zero-publish guarantee.
Stop before deployment on that combination. The
[1.34.1 binary-source publisher](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/c573ef9848309fd7ae313418f577d7f1beabac4c/cli/azd/pkg/project/container_helper.go)
implements `imagePassthroughPackageOverride`: it validates the remote reference
supplied by `--from-package`, marks it remote with `imagePassthrough` metadata,
and selects it before the build/tag/login/push branches. The
[core mapper](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/c573ef9848309fd7ae313418f577d7f1beabac4c/cli/azd/pkg/project/mapper_registry.go)
preserves `ImagePassthrough` across the extension boundary; beta.14 forwards
Publish to that core and deploys the resulting remote location unchanged.
Keep the approved registry bindings: clearing them is not a compatibility fix.
No source rebuild or SDK replacement is part of this correction.

Offline checks verified the signed released core, real core/beta.14 local IPC,
and a real core package artifact with the exact synthetic digest and
`imagePassthrough: true`. That artifact is not the extension's separate
`azure.ai.agents.imageSource: agent.yaml` fast-path marker. Full beta.14
packaging cannot be claimed credential-free: `ensureDeployContext` requires a
subscription and `Account.LookupTenant` before its passthrough branch. A
missing offline subscription is not an Azure access failure; do not fabricate a
logged-in principal to bypass it. These checks are **not live deployment or
model-response proof**.

The separate bounded private run on **2026-09-17**
([#500](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb/pull/500)) exercised this exact
core/extension pair with the previously built immutable image: one native deploy,
no additional build or publication, two direct active version GETs, one completed
model POST, independent same-session response and session/version readbacks, and
an unchanged final version GET. Owned native objects were verified absent
afterward. This dated result does not replace fresh setup observations or owner
authorization for another run. Keep the service image and explicit
`--from-package` argument identical; the local-package warning applies to
**publish**, not this verified deploy route.

Collect the [setup schema](deployment-preflight.md#setup-evidence-schema-version-1),
using the **oldest** observation timestamp. All GETs must succeed and all list
pages must be consumed. Use the exact approved IDs, not default discovery.
For connections the ordinary ARM API is:

```text
GET https://management.azure.com<project-id>/connections?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
GET https://management.azure.com<project-id>/connections/<connection-name>?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
```

Never call `listsecrets`, `include_credentials`, registry key APIs or an invented
SDK `connections.create`. Keep only ordinary GET properties without credentials
in `project_connections.value`. Compare `id`, category, target, authType and
metadata ResourceId. Preserve unrelated connections. A 403, partial response,
timeout or unsupported API is **unreadable**, never an empty list.

Supply `target.registry_connection_name` and `registry_connection_identity`:
`connection_id`, `principal_id`, `registry_id`, `source: native-provisioning`,
`evidence: <retained-native-input-or-deployment-reference>`. This is a
non-secret projection of **real reviewed native provisioning inputs**, not a
receipt fabricated from a successful GET. Ordinary GET can omit the credential
mapping. If its provenance is unavailable, stop for the owner; do not retrieve
secrets or manufacture a `pass`. Conflicting/duplicate connections or a
different identity block reuse. A correct connection is reused unchanged.

`ContainerRegistry` is **not** a Basic capability-host BYO store: leave
`threadStorageConnections`, `vectorStoreConnections`, `storageConnections` and
`aiServicesConnections` absent/empty in Basic.

### Missing only: native configuration/provisioning

This is a separately authorized prerequisite repair, never an automatic retry:

1. Retain the successful empty/missing inventory. Do **not** delete a correct
   connection to test this branch. Missing-case regression testing is offline.
2. Use [native Bicep ejection](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/2850298a3f0d9f296a4f5795b593a69115fe5b05/cli/azd/extensions/azure.ai.agents/docs/infrastructure-eject.md)
   (`azd ai agent init --infra=bicep`) in a separate owner-approved staging
   directory, targeting the existing project. Review the generated graph before
   provisioning. No new account, project, registry, host, model or role is
   authorized by a missing connection.
3. For the pinned native existing-project template, use **`acrMode:
   reuse-connect`**, exact `projectResourceId`, `existingAcrResourceId`,
   `existingAcrEndpoint`, `projectEndpoint`, `deployments: []`, and
   **`acrPullAssigned: true` only after verifying the existing effective
   project-MI pull assignment**. The native existing-project graph then skips
   the registry/RBAC module and emits only the project connection. Its name is
   `<registry-name>-conn`; a different desired name requires an explicit owner
   decision, not silent substitution. Review the ejected parameter file and
   compiled graph; a tool version with another shape must not receive guessed
   parameters.
   A connection name can already belong to a different backing workspace even
   when this project's connection list is empty. If the service reports that
   exact ownership conflict, preserve the owning project's connection and
   reconcile the failed deployment before proceeding. Use the native generic
   connection module below with an explicitly selected project-qualified name
   when authorized; never overwrite/delete the other project's connection or
   switch the configured project to make the name work.
4. A previously ejected native **generic `modules/connections.bicep`** can
   instead be reused as a connection-only module. Its verified parameter
   contract is `foundryAccountName`, `foundryProjectName`, `connections` (one
   entry with name/category/target/authType/metadata), `connectionCredentials`
   keyed by connection name (`clientId: <project-principal-id>`,
   `resourceId: <registry-id>`). Retain that module's hash and installed
   extension version. Do not provision its unrelated parent graph. No
   credential broker/password is needed; these two mapping fields are IDs.
5. Execute the reviewed connection-only **`azd provision`** once, then repeat
   ordinary connection GETs and the gate. Preserve network settings and all
   existing hosts/registry/auth state. Uncertain provisioning ACK requires
   GET reconciliation, not blind repeated provision.

Native `reuse-connect` without verified `acrPullAssigned` can emit a role
assignment. It is **not** authorized as a convenient fix for absent connection
metadata, and is especially wrong for an ABAC registry expecting repository
roles. Unknown/insufficient pull access is a separate owner decision.

## 2. Stage a minimal container

Complete the [early capability gate](deployment-preflight.md#early-capability-evidence)
before building/publishing. Retain its profile/toolchain and artifact-provenance
receipt alongside setup evidence. Do not infer adoption from the skill version.

Use a dedicated local management venv with `azure-ai-projects~=2.3.0`,
`azure-identity~=1.25.3`, `httpx~=0.28.1` and `PyYAML~=6.0`. Never update a global
SDK or mix this environment with the container's canonical dependencies.
In the commands below `$PYTHON` is that venv interpreter and `$REFS` is the
absolute path to this skill's `references` directory. `$WORK` must not exist.
Set a fresh UUID-suffixed `$AGENT` for the approved candidate; do not touch
another agent's endpoint or routing.

Choose exactly one path:

```bash
# Source container build on a network-reachable local builder.
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/private_bootstrap.py" prepare "$WORK" --agent "$AGENT" --build local

# OR prebuilt: already validated no-tools image in the selected private ACR.
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/private_bootstrap.py" prepare "$WORK" --agent "$AGENT" \
  --build prebuilt --image "$IMAGE"
```

`$IMAGE` must be `registry/repository@sha256:<digest>`, not a tag. Prebuilt does
not require a local Docker daemon. For source builds, use `--build remote` only
when the approved builder can reach the private registry/data endpoints;
never expose the registry to make remote build work.

The stager copies the canonical runtime/dependencies and creates an isolated
`app/` context. **Both `.dockerignore` and `.azdignore` allowlist only** main,
pyproject, lock and Dockerfile. `.env`, `.azure`, credentials, local venvs,
caches, evidence and sibling workspaces are not uploaded. This is a BASIC
build-context rule, not a global security-exclusion policy.

For source builds, resolve once using an already-approved Python 3.12 / uv
toolchain and retain the lock; replay with that exact file:

```bash
(cd "$WORK/app" && uv lock --python 3.12)
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/private_bootstrap.py" inventory "$WORK"
```

Set `PYTHON_IMAGE` and `UV_IMAGE` to approved **immutable** Python 3.12-slim and
uv base-image references in the local azd environment. The Dockerfile consumes
both build args and `uv sync --locked`; never silently re-resolve during build.
Export those same two values in the operator shell and run
`"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/private_bootstrap.py" check-build "$WORK" --agent "$AGENT"`
before native package/publish (or deploy for prebuilt). Keep both environment
sources equal; the output records the chosen path and exact base references.
Retain resolved package versions, base manifests, context inventory, build
output and final image config/layer descriptors. Do not mutate Docker config or
Keychain helpers globally; if auth requires local changes, stop for the owner
or use an approved process-scoped `DOCKER_CONFIG`.

## 3. Build/publish is not platform pull

In `$WORK`, configure the isolated azd environment with exact
`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID`,
`FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT`,
`AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_RESOURCE_ID`, `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`.
Registry name, endpoint and ARM ID must describe one registry. The shell and
azd values must agree; the live oracle checks each selected value without
dumping the entire environment.

**Source path:** use the installed native `azd package "$AGENT"` /
`azd publish "$AGENT"` container path to build/push **before registration**.
Retain output and independently resolve the published manifest from the selected
registry to an immutable digest. Do not guess its repository/tag. Freeze it into
a second fresh stager directory using `--build prebuilt --image "$IMAGE"`;
retain the original source directory/lock and inventory. Configure its isolated
azd env identically. The final registration path is now the same passthrough
path as prebuilt, without a second build.

**Prebuilt path:** retain source provenance and actual image validation for
this no-tools contract. For an authorized native import, compare the source
and destination **raw manifest digest and all config/layer descriptors**.
An equal tag or four equal source files is not equal image provenance. Do not
import anything as part of the smoke without the owner's approval.

For original raw platform-manifest bytes (not reformatted CLI JSON):

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/private_bootstrap.py" manifest "$MANIFEST" --digest "$DIGEST"
```

Record the manifest's media type; both Docker v2 and OCI manifests are accepted.
Resolve an index to the approved `linux/amd64` manifest explicitly, and validate
its config/platform, startup/imports and local `/home/session/.sessions` behavior.
Do not infer a live native mount write from a local check.

## 4. Register once, activate, invoke, independently read back

Refresh setup evidence for the frozen digest. For this no-tools consumer use
`target.mode: basic-private`, `registry_network: private`, `tool_endpoints: []`,
`tenant_id: <approved-tenant>`, `account.properties.disableLocalAuth: true`,
`registry.properties.adminUserEnabled: false`, and the unchanged private network
configuration. **Do not require future tool auth or invent tool-path receipts**
when no tools are requested. Retain real model/network/local-runtime prerequisites.
Use `target.model_env: AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` and the same
`environment_variables` entry as the stager's canonical YAML.

```bash
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/deploy_preflight.py" "$SETUP"
# Owner only, still within approval: assert paired tenant/subscription context,
# then one native deploy from the final passthrough directory.
# Mandatory: the core/extension compatibility gate above has passed.
azd deploy "$AGENT" --from-package "$IMAGE" --no-prompt
# Reconcile the exact returned version, emitted digest and native metadata.
# Never assume the version number or use LIST active as proof.
"$PYTHON" "$REFS/python/hosted_smoke.py" --setup "$SETUP" --agent "$AGENT" \
  --version "$VERSION" --evidence "$NEW_PRIVATE_EVIDENCE" --execute
```

The CLI writes exclusive mode-0600 JSONL; it never overwrites previous evidence.
It requires two consecutive direct version GETs (60 attempts, 10-second
intervals), exact name/version/digest/model/instance identity and native metadata,
one model request (180-second timeout, zero automatic retries), independent
response GET plus session GET, and a final unchanged active version GET.
Setup freshness remains 30 minutes throughout; expiry is a blocker, not a
reason to edit timestamps. A fresh owner authorization remains mandatory.

The oracle compares completed assistant text/message identity, response and
session IDs and the native session's version indicator. Optional `phase: null`
does not affect equality; arbitrary exact phrasing such as `billing` is not the
criterion. Tool calls, consent requests, empty output, failed/incomplete responses,
wrong session/version/image or a newer failed GET block success. There is no
SDK patch, preview routing change, `--skip` flag or synthetic business receipt.
The response GET explicitly sends `x-agent-session-id` from the completed
response's observed session ID. Projects SDK 2.3/2.6 do not derive that header
from a prior POST on the same OpenAI client; a response ID alone does not
establish Hosted session affinity. This adds no new session or extra POST.

Registration timeout/lost ACK: stop and reconcile native versions before any
retry. Pull success, registration, health and active metadata are distinct from
the final **`PRIVATE_BASIC_MODEL_PASS`** result. Record the failed stage,
status/error code/request correlation and retained private evidence. No blind
redeploys. Refresh account/ACR ordinary GETs afterward to independently confirm
private/keyless/admin-off settings stayed unchanged.

The smoke CLI deliberately performs no cleanup. Arrange exact-owned cleanup
before a non-CI run and reserve time to verify it: session first, then version
with `force=False`, then the agent if it still exists. Never delete shared or
uncertain objects. A parent can already be absent after its last version is
removed; verify absence rather than issuing another DELETE. Confirm each native
absence with two independent direct 404 reads, not auth/network failures.
Consume the complete session inventory: a retained entry with `status: deleted`
can be an owned history record even while direct session GET returns 404.
Reconcile its exact ID/version and terminal list page; do not treat it as an
active sandbox, force-delete it or claim provider purge. Separately verify owned
probes, client processes, tunnels, sockets and scratch are gone. Any retained
image/cache or attributable service history needs explicit bounded owner custody.

**Acceptance:** archive candidate SHA, exact module/tool/runtime/lock provenance,
fresh context and before/after private settings, emitted image/version/identity,
native invocation/readbacks and any failures privately. Publish only a redacted
summary, with functional success and cleanup/custody reported separately.
`PRIVATE_BASIC_MODEL_PASS` proves a plain model completion, not real
governed business effects, a standalone native mount-write test, production
readiness, or complete security certification.
