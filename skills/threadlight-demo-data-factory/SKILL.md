# Threadlight Demo Data Factory

## Presenter-ready incumbent data

For an explicitly selected presenter-ready profile, consume the process-owned
`specs/presenter-contract.json` and
[incumbent adoption map](../threadlight-deploy/references/presenter-adoption.md).
Retain existing producers and data; adoption is not permission to run seed/reset.
This selected-profile rule takes precedence over the generic reset examples below:
never wipe retained receipts, reset consumed approvals/operation IDs, or clear
UNKNOWN effects. Ordinary authorized corrections remain in scope; expired source
or authorization does not grant a new write. Preparation requires the designated
producer and a distinct synthetic revision with new lawful operation intent.
Reads must not refresh data. Exercise the day-after case: expiry denies new work
while the shell and historical reads remain available only under their own
contract, authorization and retention. Treat malformed configuration separately
from valid-but-expired data; do not force full regeneration or extend leases.

Generate per-domain synthetic demo data + idempotent reset/seed scripts for
a threadlight process. The output drives both the mock MCP server (via
`foundry-mcp-aca` Option D) and the workspace UI (via
`threadlight-workspace-ui`) — every demo surface reads the same seed.

> **Why a separate skill?** `foundry-mcp-aca` knows how to *serve* mock
> data via FastMCP; `threadlight-design` knows how to *declare* what
> entities and shapes are needed. This skill bridges them: it generates
> the actual JSON files (with realistic distributions, golden cases, and
> reset semantics) that the MCP server returns and the workspace renders.

## When to Use

- Process spec has at least one system marked `availability: mock` in § 5
- Process spec has § 11d Demo Data populated
- Demo needs reset-to-pristine for live recovery (every customer-facing
  demo does)
- Pilot is the canonization opportunity for an industry's realism rules

## When NOT to Use

- Customer's real backend is already accessible (no mocks needed)
- Demo data is so tiny it's hand-authored faster (e.g. 3 records total)
- Process talks only to public APIs (no synthetic data needed)

## Industry canons — anchor pilot pattern

Per-industry realism rules live in
`threadlight-design/references/data-realism/{industry}.md` (one of:
`fsi.md` · `retail.md` · `telco.md` · `mfg.md`). A canon is **only as
credible as the pilot it's been anchored against** — generic vocabulary
lists are aspirational; rules referenced from a *shipped* pilot's seed
JSON are testable.

| Industry | Canon file | Anchor pilot status |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| FSI | `data-realism/fsi.md` | **Anchored** to reusable financial-services realism patterns (PCI-DSS PAN masking · MCC anchors · Reg E/Z timer math · Fed holiday list · CNP fraud signals · worked examples). Compliance golden cases are aspirational pending future pilots. |
| Retail | `data-realism/retail.md` | Aspirational — awaiting PIM / returns-triage pilot. |
| Telco | `data-realism/telco.md` | Aspirational — awaiting a future telco operations pilot. |
| Mfg | `data-realism/mfg.md` | Aspirational — awaiting supplier-risk / shift-handover pilot. |

**The anchor-pilot rule.** When you generate seed data for a pilot,
mine the produced JSON for new realism rules and fold them back into
the canon as an "Anchor pilot" subsection with a worked-example table
(canon section → pilot file/field → worked value). The FSI canon's
`### Anchor-pilot worked example` table is
the template — copy that shape for sibling pilots.

**Honesty rule.** When the shipped pilot violated the canon (e.g.
real merchant names slipping through), document it in a `### Traps`
subsection with a "Don't / Do" table, NOT silently. The next pilot's
generator should reject the v3-style anti-pattern up front.

## Input contract / Output artifacts

**Input contract**:

- `specs/SPEC.md` § 4 **Data Models** — entity schemas
- `specs/SPEC.md` § 5 **System Integrations** — which systems are `mock`
- `specs/SPEC.md` § 11d **Demo Data (Realism rules)** — required:
  - Per-entity volumes
  - Distribution rules
  - Named golden cases
  - Reset semantics (`idempotent` / `append-only` / `none`)
  - Industry realism reference (e.g. `industry: fsi-banking` → loads
    `threadlight-design/references/data-realism/fsi.md`)
- `threadlight-design/references/data-realism/{industry}.md` — the
  per-industry rule book (universal rules + industry-specific overrides)

**Output**:

```

├── {entity1}.json       # Generated, includes _meta block
├── {entity2}.json

## The realism stack

```
Universal rules
   ↓ (always applied)
Industry rules (e.g. fsi.md)
   ↓ (industry-specific overrides)
Spec § 11d (per-process tweaks)
   ↓ (process-specific overrides)
Generated data
```

Each layer can override the layer above it. The factory composes them
deterministically (with a seeded RNG) so two runs of the same spec
produce byte-identical output.

---

## Generation procedure

### Step 1: Read inputs

```python
industry = spec["demo_data"]["industry"]                      # "fsi-banking", "retail-cpg", "telco", "mfg"
realism_rules = load_realism(f"data-realism/{industry}.md")
volumes = spec["demo_data"]["volumes"]                        # {"customers": 50, "orders": 200, ...}
distributions = spec["demo_data"]["distributions"]            # per-entity skew rules
golden_cases = spec["demo_data"]["golden_cases"]              # named hand-curated records
reset_mode = spec["demo_data"]["reset_semantics"]             # "idempotent" / "append-only" / "none"
entities = spec["data_models"]                                # field schemas from § 4
```

### Step 2: Generate `scripts/seed_data.py`

```python
"""Synthetic data generator — driven by spec § 11d.
Run: uv run scripts/seed_data.py [--seed 42]
Output: specs/sample-data/*.json (deterministic with --seed)
"""
import json, random
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path
from faker import Faker

# Deterministic seeding so two runs produce identical output
random.seed(42)
fake = Faker(["en_US"])
fake.seed_instance(42)

DATA_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "specs" / "sample-data"
DATA_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

def gen_customers(n: int) -> list:
    """Generates n customer records per universal + FSI rules."""
    out = []
    for i in range(n):
        out.append({
            "customer_id": f"DEMO-CUST-{i:05d}",
            "name": _shifted_company_name(),  # never a real bank
            "incorporation_date": fake.date_between(start_date="-30y", end_date="-1y").isoformat(),
            # ... fields from spec § 4 Customer entity ...
        })
    # Splice in golden cases by ID
    for golden in [g for g in GOLDEN_CASES if g["entity"] == "customers"]:
        out = [g for g in out if g["customer_id"] != golden["data"]["customer_id"]]
        out.append(golden["data"])
    return out

# ... one gen_* function per entity ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for entity in ENTITIES:
        records = ENTITY_GENERATORS[entity](VOLUMES[entity])
        path = DATA_DIR / f"{entity}.json"
        # Wrap shape: top-level object with _meta + records — NOT a list
        # of [meta, record, record, ...]. Loaders MUST do
        # `json.load(f)["records"]` and `json.load(f)["_meta"]` rather than
        # filter "is the first element a meta?". The list-with-meta-prepended
        # form silently breaks any consumer that iterates the JSON as a flat
        # array (eval scenarios, the workspace UI dataset loader, etc.).
        out = {
            "_meta": {
                "generated_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
                "seed": 42,
                "version": "1.0",
                "entity": entity,
                "count": len(records),
            },
            "records": records,
        }
        path.write_text(json.dumps(out, indent=2))
        print(f"  wrote {path} ({len(records)} records)")
```

### Cosmos data-plane RBAC — required before running seed_data.py / reset_data.py

> **Critical first-time gotcha.** Cosmos uses **separate** control-plane
> and data-plane RBAC. Control-plane Owner / Contributor lets you create
> containers but NOT write items. Data-plane writes need the **`Cosmos
> DB Built-in Data Contributor`** role (definition id
> `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`). Without it, `seed_data.py`
> fails with `Forbidden ... required RBAC permissions to perform
> action [Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/sqlDatabases/containers/items/upsert]`
> on EVERY upsert.
>
> Origin: recent pilot retrospective — first run of `seed_data.py`
> failed every upsert with Forbidden; control-plane Owner doesn't
> grant data-plane writes.

Grant once per pilot, both for the deployer (so they can run seed_data
locally) AND for the agent/bot UAMI (so the runtime can read/write):

```bash
RG=<resource-group>
COSMOS=<cosmos-account-name>
DEPLOYER_OID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
UAMI_OID=$(az identity show -g $RG -n <uami-name> --query principalId -o tsv)
SCOPE=$(az cosmosdb show -g $RG -n $COSMOS --query id -o tsv)

for OID in $DEPLOYER_OID $UAMI_OID; do
  az cosmosdb sql role assignment create -g $RG -a $COSMOS \
    --role-definition-id "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002" \
    --principal-id "$OID" \
    --scope "$SCOPE"
done
sleep 30   # RBAC propagation; 25-30s is the empirically observed minimum
```

The Bicep in `infra/modules/cosmos-db.bicep` should declare the UAMI
assignment so it survives `azd provision`; the deployer assignment is
typically a one-time bootstrap step the SE runs by hand or that lives
in `infra/scripts/postprovision.py`.

### Step 3: Generate `scripts/reset_data.py`

For `idempotent` reset:

```python
"""Reset Cosmos containers from specs/sample-data/.
Safe to run while the agent is up — completes in <30s for live demo recovery.

Usage: uv run scripts/reset_data.py [--container <name>]
"""
import asyncio, json, os
from pathlib import Path
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.cosmos.aio import CosmosClient

DATA_DIR = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "specs" / "sample-data"
COSMOS_ENDPOINT = os.environ["COSMOS_ENDPOINT"]
DB_NAME = os.environ["COSMOS_DATABASE"]

# Cap concurrent Cosmos requests so the SDK doesn't exhaust connections
# under "wipe + reload 5 containers x ~1000 docs each" parallel fan-out.
SEM = asyncio.Semaphore(8)

async def _bounded(coro):
    async with SEM:
        return await coro

async def reset_container(client, db_name: str, container_name: str, entity_file: str):
    db = client.get_database_client(db_name)
    container = db.get_container_client(container_name)

    # Read the partition-key path from container metadata so we use the
    # CORRECT field, not a guessed `partition_key` attribute. Docs can
    # legitimately omit the partition_key value (it's derived from the path).
    container_props = await container.read()
    pk_path = container_props["partitionKey"]["paths"][0].lstrip("/")

    def _pk_value(item):
        # nested-path support — pk_path can be `tenant_id` or `org/tenant_id`
        cursor = item
        for part in pk_path.split("/"):
            cursor = cursor.get(part) if isinstance(cursor, dict) else None
        return cursor if cursor is not None else item["id"]

    # Load fresh records FIRST — if loading fails, abort BEFORE deleting,
    # so a malformed JSON doesn't leave the container empty mid-demo.
    payload = json.loads((DATA_DIR / entity_file).read_text())
    records = payload["records"] if isinstance(payload, dict) else [
        r for r in payload if not r.get("_meta")  # back-compat for old shape
    ]

    # Wipe (bounded concurrency)
    await asyncio.gather(*[
        _bounded(container.delete_item(item["id"], partition_key=_pk_value(item)))
        async for item in container.read_all_items()
    ])

    # Reload (bounded concurrency)
    await asyncio.gather(*[_bounded(container.upsert_item(r)) for r in records])
    print(f"  reset {container_name}: {len(records)} records")

async def main():
    async with DefaultAzureCredential() as cred:
        async with CosmosClient(COSMOS_ENDPOINT, cred) as client:
            await asyncio.gather(*[
                reset_container(client, DB_NAME, name, file)
                for name, file in CONTAINER_MAP.items()
            ])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For `append-only`: delete only items with `_meta.demo: true` — preserve
human-introduced records. Use the same partition-key-discovery pattern;
do NOT assume a field name.

For `none`: skip generating reset_data.py (read-only datasets).

### Step 4: Generate `specs/sample-data/README.md`

```markdown
# Sample data

> Generated by `threadlight-demo-data-factory` from spec § 11d.
> Industry realism: `{industry}` (see `threadlight-design/references/data-realism/{industry}.md`)

## Files

| Entity | Records | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| customers.json | 50 | log-normal distribution; 3 golden cases |
| orders.json | 200 | mean $1,200, p99 $50K |

## Golden cases

Hand-curated records the demo script narrates around. **Do not delete or rename.**

| ID | Entity | Story beat |
|----|--------|------------|
| `DEMO-CUST-00007` | customers | Sanctioned-entity hit (KYC dramatic moment) |
| `DEMO-CUST-00042` | customers | Premium onboarding happy path (anchor case) |

## Regenerating

```bash
uv run scripts/seed_data.py            # default seed 42 — deterministic
uv run scripts/seed_data.py --seed 99  # different distribution, same structure
```

## Reset (live demo recovery)

```bash
uv run scripts/reset_data.py           # wipe Cosmos + reseed from JSON in <30s
```
```

### Step 5: Wire into the deploy

Notify `threadlight-deploy` that `scripts/seed_data.py` and
`scripts/reset_data.py` exist. The deploy adds a postdeploy step that runs
the seed script once after first provision (so the Cosmos containers come
up populated). The reset script is operator-invoked (deliberately not
automated — humans should know they're wiping demo state).

### Step 6: Validate

```
✅ scripts/seed_data.py runs, produces specs/sample-data/*.json
✅ Two runs with same --seed produce byte-identical output (deterministic)
✅ Golden cases are spliced in by ID and present in output
✅ Per-entity volumes match spec § 11d
✅ Distributions visually match expected (run a quick stats check)
✅ scripts/reset_data.py wipes + reloads in <30s on a small Cosmos
✅ Sample data passes industry realism deny-list (e.g. no real bank names)
✅ _meta block present in every output file
✅ scripts/README.md documents the golden cases and reset procedure
```

## Per-industry generators

The factory ships generators per industry. Each one lives in
`references/generators/{industry}.py` and inherits universal rules.

| Industry | Generator | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `fsi-banking` | `references/generators/fsi.py` — customers, accounts, transactions, sanctions hits | 🔶 Draft (canonized during KYC pilot) |
| `fsi-insurance` | reuses `fsi.py` with insurance-specific entities (policies, claims) | 🔶 Draft |
| `retail-cpg` | `references/generators/retail.py` — products, SKUs, orders, returns, reviews | 📋 Placeholder |
| `telco` | `references/generators/telco.py` — customers, MSISDNs, orders, faults, network elements | 📋 Placeholder |
| `mfg` | `references/generators/mfg.py` — suppliers, parts, BOMs, shipments, quality events | 📋 Placeholder |

Each generator is a Python module with one `gen_{entity}(n)` function per
entity it knows how to generate. The factory imports and calls them; if an
entity is in the spec but no generator exists, the factory falls back to a
naive Faker rendering and emits a warning ("Add a generator to elevate
realism").

---

## Reference files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `references/generators/fsi.py` | FSI banking + insurance generators (canonized during a future FSI pilot) |
| `references/generators/retail.py` | Retail / CPG generators (canonized during a future retail pilot) |

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Use random.uniform() for everything.** Real distributions are skewed.
  Plausible-looking data needs the right distribution per field.
- ❌ **Forget the _meta block.** Future-you will not know what generated
  this data without it.
- ❌ **Generate data without golden cases.** A demo without named hero
  cases is a demo without a script.
- ❌ **Use a non-deterministic seed.** Two runs MUST be reproducible —
  customers will ask "where did Acme Aerospace go?" after a regen.
- ❌ **Skip the reset script.** Every demo will eventually go off-rails.
  Reset is the only thing standing between you and a 5-minute restart.
- ❌ **Skip the realism deny-list.** One real bank name slipping through
  is one customer SME caught mid-demo. Run the deny-list grep every time.
- ❌ **Bake in customer-shared internal data.** If a customer shared their
  policy doc for context, that data stays with them — never seed it into
  a demo dataset.
