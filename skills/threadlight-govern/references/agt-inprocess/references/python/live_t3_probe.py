"""Canonical live T3 verification probe for the AGT 4.1.0 / AF 1.13.0 pin.

Source of truth for the prose example in `../../SKILL.md § Verification status`.

This is the ONLY script in this skill that touches real Azure resources. It
proves, against a real `<ci-foundry-account>` deployment in
`<ci-resource-group>`, everything `contract_probe.py` cannot prove offline:

  - the 5 workflow-provided OIDC/Foundry environment variables are present
  - the exact pinned package versions are installed (mirrors, and adds exact
    ``*_VERSION=`` lines on top of, ``contract_probe.check_versions()``)
  - a real async ``DefaultAzureCredential`` acquires a real Entra token for
    the ``https://ai.azure.com/.default`` scope
  - a real ``FoundryChatClient`` runs one benign prompt through a real,
    governed ``Agent`` (the same real AGT factory middleware stack
    ``contract_probe.build_factory_stack`` assembles, plus a counting
    ``ChatMiddleware`` proven against the released AF 1.13 ``call_next()``
    no-argument shape) and gets back a real, non-empty response
  - the SAME real ``CapabilityGuardMiddleware`` instance deterministically
    allows the allowed tool exactly once and denies the denied tool before
    it ever executes, reusing ``contract_probe.exercise_capability_hook``
    verbatim rather than duplicating that hook path
  - the shared ``AuditLog`` accumulates real, integrity-verified evidence
    (CloudEvents) from that real allow/deny cycle

It deliberately reuses ``contract_probe.py``'s already-proven no-network
symbols (``EXPECTED_VERSIONS``, ``POLICY_DIR``, ``check_imports``,
``check_versions``, ``build_factory_stack``, ``exercise_capability_hook``)
via a normal local-module import rather than redefining any of that logic.

Pre-implementation API proof (see the skill's SKILL.md § Verification status
for the summary) empirically confirmed two things this probe relies on. Both
were independently re-litigated a second time, live, against the exact
pinned package set in a disposable venv — after a report claimed the
opposite of each — and both re-confirmed the original finding:

  1. Released AF 1.13's ``ChatMiddleware.process(self, context, call_next)``
     calls ``call_next()`` with NO arguments — data flows through the
     mutable ``context``, not through a return value or an argument to
     ``call_next``. Re-verified live: driving this exact probe's
     ``run_live_inference`` through the real AGT governance stack plus a
     ``ChatMiddlewareLayer``-composed stub client (the same base classes the
     real ``FoundryChatClient`` is actually built from) succeeds with the
     committed no-argument ``await call_next()``; the identical middleware
     changed to ``await call_next(context)`` instead raises a real
     ``TypeError: ...final_wrapper() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was
     given`` from ``agent_framework``'s own ``ChatMiddlewarePipeline``. The
     one call site anywhere in the installed dependency tree that DOES pass
     an argument (``await call_next(request)`` in an unrelated
     ``agent_os/server/app.py`` HTTP handler) is the Starlette/FastAPI HTTP
     middleware convention, a different API entirely from
     ``agent_framework.ChatMiddleware``.
  2. The real ``CapabilityGuardMiddleware`` auto-logs to a supplied
     ``AuditLog`` on both allow (``tool_invocation`` start + complete) and
     deny (``tool_blocked``) — this probe never appends a manual fallback
     audit entry because the empirical proof showed one is never needed, and
     appending one would silently double-count real evidence the guard
     already recorded. Re-verified live at two levels of granularity: (a) in
     isolation, a bare ``cp.build_factory_stack`` + ``cp.exercise_capability_hook``
     cycle, with zero manual ``audit_log.log(...)`` calls anywhere, produces
     exactly 3 real CloudEvents from the guard alone (2
     ``ai.agentmesh.tool.invoked`` for the allowed execution's start/complete
     pair, 1 ``ai.agentmesh.tool.blocked`` for the denied execution) —
     confirmed both black-box, via ``export_cloudevents()`` before any manual
     log call, and by reading the guard's own installed source, whose legacy
     ``_process_v4`` path unconditionally calls ``self.audit_log.log(...)`` at
     all three points whenever ``self.audit_log`` is set; and (b) end-to-end,
     driving this probe's real, full ``run_live_inference`` then
     ``check_capability_hook_live`` sequence against one shared ``AuditLog``
     deterministically (reproduced identically across repeated runs)
     accumulates exactly 6 real CloudEvents: the first 3 (2
     ``ai.agentmesh.agent_invocation`` + 1 ``ai.agentmesh.policy.evaluation``)
     come from ``AuditTrailMiddleware``/``GovernancePolicyMiddleware`` --
     also members of the same real governance ``stack`` -- auto-logging the
     live chat call inside ``run_live_inference``'s own governed
     ``Agent.run()``; the next 3 are the guard's own allow/deny cycle from
     ``check_capability_hook_live``, as in (a).

Run directly, with the exact bounded package set from ``../upstream-pin.md``
installed and the 5 required environment variables present in the shell:

    python3 references/python/live_t3_probe.py

Never prints secret values, tokens, or identifiers — only presence/absence
markers and counts.

    ``AzureCliCredential``: the fixture's own Step 2 Bash script performs an
