    v4.1.0 — released source tag. The meta-package now splits into
    agent-governance-toolkit-{core,integrations,cli,protocols}, all 4.1.0.
  license: MIT
  notes: |
    Pinned to the `v4.1.0` release tag, not `main` HEAD — this skill
    previously tracked `main` and was burned by an unreleased breaking
    change. automation_tier is issue_only because Agent Governance
    Toolkit is Public Preview and Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) minor
    releases have changed this skill's factory/Agent contract before; a
    human must re-run the live-API verification pass below (or re-run
    `references/python/contract_probe.py` against the candidate version)
    before trusting any future auto-detected drift.

packages:
  - name: agent-governance-toolkit
    source: pypi
    version: "4.1.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/releases
    notes: |
      Meta-package; install with the `[full]` extra. The importable
      module surface this skill depends on (`agent_os.integrations.maf_adapter`,
      `agent_os.policies`, `agentmesh.governance`) is unchanged from the
      prior AGT 3.x pin despite the PyPI package split into
      agent-governance-toolkit-{core,integrations,cli,protocols} — all
      re-verified live against 4.1.0 in `contract_probe.py`.
  - name: agent-framework-core
    source: pypi
    version: "1.13.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/agent-framework-core/#history
    notes: |
      Selective, bounded MAF package — NOT the broad `agent-framework`
      meta-package the prior 3.x-era pin used. This skill only needs
      Agent / ChatResponse / Message / middleware plumbing, so pinning
      the specific sub-packages it imports (core, foundry, openai) keeps
      the candidate set small and auditable instead of dragging in the
      full MAF surface area on every refresh.
  - name: agent-framework-foundry
    source: pypi
    version: "1.10.4"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/agent-framework-foundry/#history
    notes: |
      Provides `FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint, model, credential)`.
      Constructor signature re-verified live at 1.10.4 — the skill body's
      documented shape is unchanged.
  - name: agent-framework-openai
    source: pypi
    version: "1.12.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/agent-framework-openai/#history
    notes: |
      Transitive dependency of the `Agent.run` response-handling path
      this skill exercises; pinned explicitly (not left to resolver
      discretion) so a drifting transitive version can't silently change
      `ChatResponse` shape underneath the skill.
  - name: azure-identity
    source: pypi
    version: "1.25.3"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/#history
    notes: |
      Credential surface only. `AccessToken` itself imports from
      `azure.core.credentials`, not `azure-identity` — this pin only
      bounds the `DefaultAzureCredential`-shaped surface the skill's
      Foundry construction path documents.

# Upstream pin — `threadlight-govern/references/agt-inprocess` skill

This file captures the exact upstream state the skill body is authored
against, plus the GBB-discovered field findings from live verification.
Bump the SKILL.md `metadata.version` (MAJOR, this is a breaking refresh)
whenever you re-pin, and re-run `references/python/contract_probe.py`
before trusting the new candidate set.

---

## Why a released source tag, not `main`

The prior AGT 3.x pin tracked `ref: main`. This refresh moves to the
`v4.1.0` release tag (SHA `0de71ca6c95cf8b9b975ac96f48eaa7826bbe258`) —
a released source snapshot is reproducible; `main` HEAD is not, and can
carry unreleased breaking changes between one CI run and the next.
`automation_tier` stays `issue_only`: AGT is Public Preview and MAF
minor releases have changed this skill's `Agent`/factory contract
before, so a human reviews every refresh rather than an autonomous
bump merging on green CI alone.

---

## Selective, bounded MAF packages

The prior 3.x-era pin installed the broad `agent-framework` meta-package.
This refresh pins the three sub-packages the skill actually imports
instead:

| Package | Pinned | What it provides for this skill |
|---------|--------|----------------------------------|
| `agent-framework-core` | 1.13.0 | `Agent`, `ChatResponse`, `Message`, `FunctionTool`, `FunctionInvocationContext`, `MiddlewareTermination` |
| `agent-framework-foundry` | 1.10.4 | `FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint, model, credential)` |
| `agent-framework-openai` | 1.12.0 | transitive dependency of the `Agent.run` response path |

Pinning the specific sub-packages (rather than the meta-package) keeps
the candidate set small, keeps `pip check` fast, and avoids dragging in
MAF extras (voice, realtime, etc.) this governance-focused skill never
touches.

---

## Upstream packages (verified live at authoring time)

| Package | Source | Pinned version |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `agent-governance-toolkit` | PyPI (`pip install agent-governance-toolkit[full]`) | **4.1.0** |
| `agent-governance-toolkit` repo | <https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit> | tag `v4.1.0` (`0de71ca6...`) |
| `agent-framework-core` | PyPI | **1.13.0** |
| `agent-framework-foundry` | PyPI | **1.10.4** |
| `agent-framework-openai` | PyPI | **1.12.0** |
| `azure-identity` | PyPI | **1.25.3** |

`contract_probe.py` verifies each of these exact versions with
`importlib.metadata.version(...)` before touching any API surface —
if the installed candidate set drifts from the table above, the probe
fails before running a single behavioral check.

---

## `agt doctor` legacy package-table lag (cosmetic, not a functional failure)

Live output against a correctly installed 4.1.0 `[full]` candidate set:

```text
$ agt doctor
 1/8 packages installed
```

`agt doctor`'s package table still checks for the pre-split distribution
names (`agent_os_kernel`, `agentmesh_platform`, `agentmesh_runtime`,
`agent_sre`, `agentmesh_marketplace`, `agentmesh_lightning`,
`agent_hypervisor`) — none of which are separate installable
distributions any more under the 4.1.0 package split. Only the meta-package
itself (`agent_governance_toolkit`) matches, hence "1/8". This is a
**known, empirically observed cosmetic gap** (KI-002) in the doctor
subcommand, not evidence of a broken install: `contract_probe.py`'s
version and import checks are the authoritative signal for "is 4.1.0
actually installed and importable", and they pass.

## `agt verify` version skew (cosmetic, not a functional failure)

Live output against the same candidate set:

```text
$ agt verify
Agent Governance Toolkit — Verification PASSED ✅
OWASP ASI 2026 Coverage: 10/10 (100%)
Toolkit: 3.2.2
```

`agt verify` self-reports its own compliance-schema version
(`Toolkit: 3.2.2`), independent of the installed meta-package version
(4.1.0). This is a **known, empirically observed skew** (KI-003) between the
verifier's internal schema numbering and the package release cadence —
the OWASP ASI 2026 coverage result (10/10) is what this skill's
validation script actually gates on, and it is unaffected by the skew.

`agt verify` is a **self-assessment** the toolkit runs against its own
policy/audit/capability surfaces — it is not an independent
certification, and this pin does not represent it as one.

---

## Verified API surface (4.1.0 / MAF 1.13.0) — relevant parameters

These are the **relevant parameters** from `inspect.signature(...)`,
re-verified live for this refresh — not the complete signature. Each
constructor also carries internal/advanced keyword-only parameters this
skill never sets (`create_governance_middleware`'s `policy`,
`approval_resolver`, `_runtime`, `_runtime_factory`) that are omitted
below for brevity. `contract_probe.py` is the executable source of
truth — this section is a human-readable summary, not a substitute for
running the probe.

```python
from agent_os.integrations.maf_adapter import (
    AuditTrailMiddleware,          # (audit_log: AuditLog, agent_did: str | None = None)
    CapabilityGuardMiddleware,     # (allowed_tools=None, denied_tools=None, audit_log=None,
                                    #  *, kernel: MAFKernel | None = None, agent_id: str = "maf-agent")
    GovernancePolicyMiddleware,    # (evaluator: PolicyEvaluator | None = None, audit_log: AuditLog | None = None,
                                    #  *, kernel: MAFKernel | None = None, agent_id: str = "maf-agent")
    create_governance_middleware,  # ← USE THIS — assembles the stack correctly
)

# create_governance_middleware factory (RECOMMENDED entry point)
#   policy_directory: str | Path | None = None,
#   allowed_tools: list[str] | None = None,
#   denied_tools: list[str] | None = None,
#   agent_id: str = "default-agent",
#   enable_rogue_detection: bool = True,
#   audit_log: AuditLog | None = None,
# Returns: list[Middleware] in execution order. The stack size is
# conditional on BOTH the tool-list configuration and the explicit
# enable_rogue_detection flag — it is not a fixed 3-or-4:
#   policy_directory set, allowed_tools=None, denied_tools=None,
#   enable_rogue_detection=False (explicit)
#     -> 2: AuditTrailMiddleware, GovernancePolicyMiddleware
#   policy_directory set, either allowed_tools or denied_tools configured
#   (including an empty list), enable_rogue_detection=False (explicit)
#     -> 3: + CapabilityGuardMiddleware
#   policy_directory set, allowed_tools=None, denied_tools=None,
#   enable_rogue_detection=True (or omitted — this is now the default)
#     -> 3: + RogueDetectionMiddleware (no guard)
#   policy_directory set, either allowed_tools or denied_tools configured,
#   enable_rogue_detection=True (or omitted — this is now the default)
#     -> 4: + CapabilityGuardMiddleware + RogueDetectionMiddleware
```

```python
from agent_framework import Agent

# Agent ctor (1.13.0):
#   Agent(client, instructions=None, *, name=None, middleware=None, tools=None, ...)
# - first positional is `client` (NOT `chat_client`)
# - `middleware` accepts the list returned by create_governance_middleware()
```

```python
from agent_framework.foundry import FoundryChatClient

# FoundryChatClient ctor (1.10.4):
#   FoundryChatClient(project_endpoint: str, model: str, credential, ...)
# - constructs with zero network calls; exposes the resolved model via
#   `.model` (NOT `.model_id`)
```

```python
from agentmesh.governance import AuditLog

# Public methods (use these, NOT private `.entries`):
#   log(event_type, agent_did, action, resource=None, data=None, outcome="success",
#       policy_decision=None, trace_id=None) -> AuditEntry
#   verify_integrity()         # hash-chain integrity
#   export_cloudevents(...)    # OTel-compatible export
```

```python
from agent_os.policies import PolicyEvaluator

# Public methods:
#   load_policies(directory: str | Path)      # loads *.yaml + *.yml files
#   evaluate(context: dict) -> PolicyDecision
```

## Known Issues (GBB field findings)

These belong in the SKILL.md "Known Issues" section, but are pinned
here so the next refresh remembers to re-test them.

### Issue 1 — `agt doctor` legacy package-table lag

See "`agt doctor` legacy package-table lag" above (KI-002). Do not
treat "N/8 packages installed" as a failed install; it only reflects
the pre-split package names the doctor subcommand still checks for.

### Issue 2 — Rogue detection is upstream's default now, not this skill's

In the AGT 3.x pin, `enable_rogue_detection=True` was documented as
raising without an explicit `RogueAgentDetector` + `capability_profile`.
Re-verified live at 4.1.0: `create_governance_middleware(enable_rogue_detection=True)`
now constructs successfully — it does **not** raise. The upstream
factory's own default also flipped: `enable_rogue_detection` now
defaults to `True` (it defaulted to `False` in the AGT 3.x pin), so
`RogueDetectionMiddleware` is added by default — as the 3rd stack item
when no `allowed_tools`/`denied_tools` are configured, or the 4th when
either is (see "Verified API surface" above for the full four-case
breakdown).

This skill's own snippet (`maf-middleware-snippet.py`) and
`contract_probe.py`'s `build_factory_stack` deliberately pass
`enable_rogue_detection=False` explicitly, overriding the new upstream
default — not because the upstream factory still defaults to `False`
(it no longer does), but because a freshly deployed agent has no
behavioral baseline for the detector to compare against yet. `SKILL.md`
documents this skill's own explicit choice, which does not conflict
with the upstream default documented here: one is the toolkit's
factory default, the other is this skill's deliberate override of it.

### Issue 3 — `agt verify` version skew

See "`agt verify` version skew" above (KI-003).
