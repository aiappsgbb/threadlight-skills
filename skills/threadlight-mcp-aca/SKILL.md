# Foundry MCP ACA Deployment

> 🎯 **Scope: PRODUCER-side only.** This skill is for **hosting** MCP servers on
> Azure Container Apps or Azure Functions, NOT for **consuming** a remote MCP from
> a Foundry hosted agent (e.g. calling `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp` or
> `https://api.github.com/mcp` from your agent's `container.py`).
>
> - **Producer (this skill):** you're WRITING + DEPLOYING an MCP server.
>   Cosmos MCP, Playwright MCP, custom MCP for an internal API, etc.
> - **Consumer (different skill):** you're WRITING a Foundry hosted agent that
>   CALLS a remote MCP server. Use [`threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf`](../threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf/README.md)
>   § MCP Tools via FoundryChatClient + § MCP Tools — recommended pattern.
>
> Confusing the two costs hours. The consumer-side pattern is `MCPStreamableHTTPTool`
> wired into `Agent(tools=[…])`; the producer-side is everything below.

> ⚠️ **Azure Tenant Isolation (mandatory).** Before any `azd` or `az`
> operation, verify tenant isolation per
> [`threadlight-tenant-isolation`](../threadlight-tenant-isolation/SKILL.md): set config dirs,
> check token, assert subscription. See that skill's Agent preflight.

Deploy custom MCP servers as **Azure Container Apps** or **Azure Functions** for
use with Foundry hosted agents. The hosted agent container connects to these MCP
servers via HTTP at runtime using `client.get_mcp_tool()`.

## When to Use

- Deploying a Cosmos DB MCP server for agent data access
- Running Playwright/browser automation as a remote MCP server
- Creating a custom MCP server for an API or data store not covered by Foundry built-ins
- Deploying an MCP server as an Azure Function (consumption billing)

## Capability and identity preflight

Before preparing an image, record the selected ACA environment type, region,
supported ingress/auth features, registry authorization mode and exact
API/SDK cohort from this skill's upstream pin. An unsupported feature is
`UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`; a missing owner choice is a blocker, not permission
to change the environment. Do not use the hosted agent's azd profile as proof
of compatibility for an ACA service.

Reuse the [hosted capability/evidence vocabulary](../threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf/references/deployment-preflight.md#early-capability-evidence)
for the producer's read-only review. The producer has distinct subjects:
deployer, ACA image-pull identity, inbound caller, server MI accessing the
source, and independent result reader. For each, record the actual target,
required data actions, effective roles/conditions and API version.
An RG-wide elevated-role audit is not proof of these permissions.

**Registry feasibility precedes build.** Repository-only access requires an
ABAC registry, effective repository conditions and exclusion of broader pull
grants. Legacy `AcrPull` is registry-wide. Do not grant a broad role, change a
shared registry's mode or treat a successful deployer push as runtime pull.
The existing ACA module declares an identity; it does not prove that grant.

**Ingress trust is deployment-specific.** Easy Auth must enforce authentication
on the actual route, replace caller-supplied principal headers, and leave no
direct backend bypass. Socket peer, forwarded client IP and authenticated
principal are different facts. Ignore arbitrary forwarded headers; trust only
the explicitly verified proxy chain. No wildcard trusted-proxy shortcut.
Private routing, authConfig support and effective config must be verified on
the selected environment before depending on them.

Follow the [operation recovery contract](../threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf/references/operation-recovery.md)
for stateful tools and delivery adapters. A tool error, generic404 or missing
browser assertion is not permission to repeat a write. Capture the original
operation identity/status before parsing and use the declared result reader.

## Architecture

```
┌────────────────────────┐     HTTPS      ┌─────────────────────┐
│  Hosted Agent Container │ ─────────────► │  MCP ACA            │
│  client.get_mcp_tool()  │               │  (e.g. Cosmos MCP)  │
│  Agent + ResponsesHost  │               │  Port 8080 /mcp     │
└────────────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

The hosted agent container:
1. Loads `mcp-config.json` at startup (or `MCP_SERVER_URL` env var)
2. Creates `client.get_mcp_tool(name=..., url=..., approval_mode="never_require")` per server
3. Passes tools to `Agent(tools=[...])` alongside skill-loaded instructions

---

## MCP Protocol Requirements

**Successful JSON-RPC requests return HTTP 200; accepted notifications return HTTP 202** (per [MCP 2025-06-18 transport spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports)).
Authentication, transport and invalid-session failures retain their meaningful
HTTP status; never turn them into a success-shaped response.
Failing to handle any of these causes `FoundryChatClient.get_mcp_tool()` to silently fail.

| Method | Purpose | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `initialize` | Protocol handshake | Must return server capabilities |
| `notifications/initialized` | Client notification | HTTP 202 Accepted (no body) |
| `tools/list` | Discover available tools | Must return tool definitions |
| `prompts/list` | List prompts | Required by agent-framework (return empty list) |
| `resources/list` | List resources | Required by agent-framework (return empty list) |
| `logging/setLevel` | Set log level | Per [MCP spec § Logging](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/logging) — camelCase `setLevel` (capital L). Lowercase `setlevel` returns `-32601 Method not found` from spec-compliant clients. |

**Transport requirements:**
- Foundry only accepts **remote HTTP** MCP endpoints (no stdio, no local)
- Use Streamable HTTP transport (HTTP POST with JSON-RPC at `/mcp`)
- Non-streaming tool call timeout: **100 seconds**
- Private MCP (VNet) requires Standard Agent Setup
- Port 8080 is convention for ACA MCP servers
- Health endpoint at `/health` (separate from MCP protocol)

---

## Option A: Cosmos DB MCPToolKit (.NET)

A pre-built .NET Cosmos DB MCPToolKit image provides 10 tools out of the box:

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `list_databases` | Read | List all Cosmos databases |
| `list_collections` | Read | List containers in a database |
| `find_document_by_id` | Read | Get single document by id |
| `text_search` | Read | Text search across documents |
| `query_documents` | Read | SQL query against a container |
| `get_approximate_schema` | Read | Infer schema from sample docs |
| `get_recent_documents` | Read | Get N most recent documents |
| `vector_search` | Read | Semantic vector search |
| `upsert_document` | Write | Create or update a document |
| `delete_document` | Write | Delete a document by id |

### Deployment

Deploy as a per-project ACA. **Prefer keyless (managed identity) over Cosmos keys** —
disable account keys at the Cosmos resource (`disableLocalAuth: true`).

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` | ✅ | Cosmos DB account endpoint |
| `COSMOS_DATABASE` | ✅ | Default database name |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | ✅ (keyless) | UAMI client ID — the MCPToolKit's Cosmos SDK uses `DefaultAzureCredential` which reads this |
| `COSMOS_AUTH_KEY` | ❌ avoid | Cosmos master key. Only for local dev; for ACA, **disable account keys** at the Cosmos resource (`disableLocalAuth: true`) and grant the UAMI `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor` (data-plane RBAC, NOT control-plane Contributor) on the database scope |
| `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH` | No | Set `true` only for local dev; never in prod |

> **RBAC pin (verified May 2026).** Cosmos DB SQL API data-plane access is
> NOT granted by control-plane roles like `Contributor` or
> `DocumentDB Account Contributor`. You MUST assign the data-plane role
> `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`
> (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`) via `az cosmosdb sql role
> assignment create`. This is the same gotcha called out in
> `threadlight-hitl-patterns` — keep both wirings consistent.

> **⚠️ aiohttp dep is mandatory for the Python Cosmos MCP server.** The Python Cosmos MCPToolKit uses `azure-cosmos` async client which
> silently requires `aiohttp` as the HTTP transport. Without it the container starts
> fine, `tools/list` returns the 11 tools, but every `upsert_item` / `query_items`
> call fails server-side with what looks like a Cosmos error but is actually an
> ImportError swallowed by FastMCP. Pin in `src/mcp/requirements.txt`:
>
> ```
> fastmcp>=2.0.0,<3.0.0  # MUST upper-bound — see callout below
> azure-cosmos>=4.15.0   # see kwarg callout below
> azure-identity>=1.19.0
> mcp>=1.10.0
> aiohttp>=3.9.0         # REQUIRED — async HTTP transport for azure-cosmos
> ```

> **⚠️ Pin `fastmcp<3.0.0` — the unbounded `>=2.0.0` pin is a re-deploy time bomb.**
> FastMCP 3.x changed the streamable-http mount path. If `requirements.txt` says
> `fastmcp>=2.0.0` (no upper bound), the next container rebuild will pull
> **fastmcp 3.x silently** the moment it ships on PyPI. Symptoms — agent says
> *"case read failed"* / *"audit-log screening read failed"* on every tool call,
> bot/MCP logs show every single request as `POST /mcp HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found`,
> the MCP container itself is `Healthy` and `Running`. **FastMCP itself prints
> the warning at boot:**
>
> ```
> FastMCP 3.0 is coming!
> Pin `fastmcp < 3` in production, then upgrade when you're ready.
> ```
>
> If you skim past that and ship, every Cosmos tool call will 404. A real
> deployment burned an hour on this when an unrelated `azd deploy` rebuild
> jumped fastmcp 2.14.7 → 3.2.4 and broke point reads + queries simultaneously.
> Always upper-bound: `fastmcp>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`. Same rule applies to **any
> client** that imports `fastmcp` (e.g. an ACA Job that drives the MCP) — pin
> client + server to the same major.
>
> **🛑 DO NOT bump `fastmcp` major version without re-running the demo scenarios** — the streamable-http mount path changed between 2.x and 3.x. Every Cosmos tool call will fail silently if the path moves. **DO test locally first:** `pip install 'fastmcp>=3' && python -m pytest tests/ -k cosmos_mcp`.

> **⚠️ `enable_cross_partition_query` was DROPPED in `azure-cosmos>=4.15` async.**
> If your `query_items` tool implementation passes `enable_cross_partition_query=True`,
> the kwarg leaks down to `aiohttp.ClientSession._request()` and raises
> `TypeError: ClientSession._request() got an unexpected keyword argument
> 'enable_cross_partition_query'`. FastMCP swallows the traceback and surfaces
> only `Error calling tool 'query_items'` — the agent then says "case lookup
> failed" on every related read while point reads (`get_item`) keep working.
>
> The new async signature is partition-key-aware by inference:
>
> ```python
> # ❌ Old (works on azure-cosmos<4.15, breaks on >=4.15):
> async for item in container.query_items(
>     query=q, parameters=p, enable_cross_partition_query=True,
> ):
>     ...
>
> # ✅ New: omit partition_key for cross-partition; pass it for single-partition:
> kwargs = {"query": q, "parameters": p}
> if partition_key is not None:
>     kwargs["partition_key"] = partition_key
> async for item in container.query_items(**kwargs):
>     ...
> ```
>
> This is a **silent migration trap** — the SDK dependency floats forward, the
> kwarg used to be valid, and the runtime error message blames the tool name
> not the SDK call. Catches every Cosmos MCP that pinned `azure-cosmos>=4.7`
> instead of `>=4.15`.
>
> **🛑 DO NOT rely on cross-partition queries for MCP tool calls without explicit user consent** — partition-scoped queries are cheaper and more predictable. **DO scope per-partition or accept the cost & latency impact.** If you must cross-partition, document it as a tool contract in SPEC § 6 so the agent knows to prefer partition-scoped alternatives when available.

> **Historical stale-session observation after MCP redeploy — verify the selected client.**
> FastMCP's streamable-http maintains per-client session state in-memory on the MCP
> container. When you redeploy the MCP server (`azd deploy cosmos-mcp` /
> `azd deploy <mock-mcp-service>` / any new container revision), every session is wiped.
> In the observed older client, the cached `mcp-session-id` from the previous
> initialize handshake kept being sent with `tools/call` without a successful
> re-handshake. In that incident, tool calls returned
> 404 silently, agent self-reports `case read failed` / `audit-log query failed`
> on EVERY tool, MCP container is `Healthy` and `Running`, MCP logs show
> `POST /mcp HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found` **without** the preceding `new transport
> with session ID: ...` log line that a fresh handshake would produce. External
> probes to `/mcp` with proper Accept headers return `200 OK` — the path is fine,
> the SESSION is gone.
>
> **Distinguishing this from the FastMCP 3.x mount-path 404:**
>
> | Symptom | FastMCP 3.x mount-path | Stale session-id |
> |---|---|---|
> | MCP log line | `POST /mcp HTTP/1.1" 404` (no transport log either way) | `POST /mcp HTTP/1.1" 404` (no `new transport with session ID` log preceding) |
> | External probe with `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` | `404 Not Found` (path moved) | `200 OK` (path fine) |
> | External probe with stale `mcp-session-id` header | `404 Not Found` (path moved) | `404 {"error":{"code":-32600,"message":"Session not found"}}` |
> | Discriminator before remediation | Verify the actual mounted route and pinned package | Verify the original session error and the client's reinitialization contract |
>
> **Historical recovery sequence, not an automatic repair:**
>
> ```bash
> # After: azd deploy cosmos-mcp   (or any MCP service)
> # Only after identifying the stale session and obtaining explicit authorization:
> azd deploy <agent-service-name>      # creates a new agent version, fresh compute
>
> # And restart the bot ACA replica so its connection pool is dropped:
> az containerapp revision restart \
>   -g <rg> -n <bot-aca-name> \
>   --revision $(az containerapp revision list -g <rg> -n <bot-aca-name> \
>                  --query "[?properties.active] | [0].name" -o tsv)
> ```
>
> **Alternatively** — wait ~15 min idle and the refreshed-preview hosted agent
> auto-deprovisions; the next user message will spin up fresh compute with a
> fresh MCP session. But "wait 15 min" isn't a fix you can put in a runbook.
>
> Client reinitialization support is version-specific. This incident does not

>
> Before any recovery, distinguish a wrong route, auth failure and an actual

### Cosmos firewall + ACA egress (the trap that wastes 45 min on every fresh deployment)

The single biggest "first-deploy doesn't work" gotcha for ACA→Cosmos:

| Default | What happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Cosmos `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled` (the Azure default) | All ACA→Cosmos traffic returns `Forbidden — public access disabled` | Set `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled` for development (production: use private endpoint) |
| Cosmos `networkAclBypass: None` (default) AND `ipRules: []` | All ACA→Cosmos traffic returns `Forbidden — Request originated from IP <egress-ip> through public internet. This is blocked` | Either: (a) set `networkAclBypass: AzureServices` ⚠️ (see caveat) OR (b) add the ACA environment's egress IP to `ipRules` (proven path for non-production environments) |
| `networkAclBypass: AzureServices` is set, ACA still blocked | Even with `AzureServices` bypass, ACA managed-environment egress can still be treated as "public internet" by Cosmos. The bypass DOES NOT cover ACA the way it covers Functions/Logic Apps. | **Add the ACA egress IP to `ipRules` explicitly.** Get it from the Cosmos Forbidden error message ("Request originated from IP X.X.X.X"), then `az cosmosdb update -g <rg> -n <acct> --ip-range-filter "X.X.X.X"`. For prod, use a private endpoint instead. |

**Bicep snippet** (development-grade default — put this in `infra/modules/cosmos-db.bicep`):

```bicep
@description('Pilot posture (canonical — see threadlight-deploy/references/azd-modules): enables public network with AzureServices bypass + room for explicit ACA egress IP. Set false for prod-grade (private endpoint).')
param pilotPosture bool = true

@description('Optional explicit IP allowlist (for ACA egress IPs). Pilots: leave empty initially, then re-deploy with the IP from the Cosmos Forbidden error.')
param ipAllowlist array = []

resource cosmos 'Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts@2024-12-01-preview' = {
  // ...
  properties: {
    publicNetworkAccess: pilotPosture ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled'
    networkAclBypass: pilotPosture ? 'AzureServices' : 'None'
    ipRules: [for ip in ipAllowlist: { ipAddressOrRange: ip }]
    disableLocalAuth: true   // keyless-by-mandate
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Operator runbook for the "ACA→Cosmos Forbidden" failure** (post-deploy):

```bash
# 1. Pull the egress IP from the cosmos-mcp ACA logs
az containerapp logs show -g <rg> -n ca-<process>-cosmos-mcp-<token> --tail 200 \
  | grep -i "Request originated from IP"
# Example output: "Request originated from IP 135.116.230.235 through public internet"

# 2. Add it to Cosmos firewall (REST PATCH; CLI does not expose --enable-public-network)
az rest --method PATCH \
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/<acct>?api-version=2024-12-01-preview" \
  --body '{"properties":{"publicNetworkAccess":"Enabled","ipRules":[{"ipAddressOrRange":"135.116.230.235"}]}}'

# 3. Wait 60-180s for Cosmos provisioningState to flip Updating -> Succeeded
az cosmosdb show -g <rg> -n <acct> --query "provisioningState" -o tsv
```

**Or automate it as a postdeploy hook (recommended for fully unattended `azd up`).**
Reference implementation: [`references/postdeploy_cosmos_firewall_egress.py`](references/postdeploy_cosmos_firewall_egress.py)
in this skill. The script:

1. Reads `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` / `AZURE_COSMOS_ACCOUNT_NAME` from azd env
2. Auto-discovers the cosmos-mcp ACA name (first ACA matching `*cosmos-mcp*`)
3. Polls the ACA's recent console logs (up to 5 min) for the Cosmos Forbidden error pattern
4. Extracts the egress IP, idempotently patches Cosmos `ipRules`
5. Polls Cosmos `provisioningState` until `Succeeded`

Wire it into `azure.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  postdeploy:
    shell: pwsh
    run: |
      cd infra/scripts && uv sync --frozen
      uv run postdeploy.py
      uv run postdeploy_cosmos_firewall_egress.py
```

This closes the last manual step in the "1-shot `azd up` for Cosmos-using
processes" flow. Verified design against real deployment experience.

### Agent Configuration

In the hosted agent's `mcp-config.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "cosmos-tools": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "${MCP_SERVER_URL}/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Set `MCP_SERVER_URL` in the environment field of the selected
[hosted profile](../threadlight-deploy/references/hosted-agent/maf/references/hosted-contract.json).
Do not mix legacy `agent.yaml` fields into a unified `azure.yaml`.

---

## Option B: Azure Functions (Consumption)

For lightweight, consumption-billed MCP servers:

```bash
# Scaffold from template
azd init --template remote-mcp-functions-python -e my-mcp-server

# Test locally
func start

# Deploy to Azure
azd up

# Endpoint: https://{app}.azurewebsites.net/runtime/webhooks/mcp
```

Azure Functions use HTTP Streamable transport by default.

---

## Option C: Custom ACA

Build a custom Docker image with your MCP tools and deploy as ACA.

**CI fixture cleanup:** shared infrastructure is never the teardown target.
The fixture uses
[`fixture_ownership.py`](references/python/fixture_ownership.py) to record
pre-create absence and a unique run tag, capture the exact app receipt, and
delete only that app after a fresh ownership/context check. The
[`failure guard`](references/bash/fixture_cleanup_guard.sh) runs cleanup on
intermediate shell failures without masking their exit status. Unknown creates
are reconciled by exact ID, not replayed. Image/deployment artifacts without
proven custody remain explicit inventory residuals; a prefix is not ownership
and a shared registry/repository must not be deleted to clean one image.
The cleanup fix has offline transport/shell coverage. A scoped manual check
on 2026-09-25 exercised the real helper with one new UUID-tagged MCR-placeholder
app through `azd provision`: the app was removed, and the separately proven
owned deployment-history record was deleted without touching shared resources.
No image was built or pushed. An unclassified post-delete 404 was not treated
as absence; a later typed ARM read confirmed removal. The helper now records
and re-observes that ambiguous post-delete response within its existing bound,
without reissuing DELETE. This is not proof of the full MCP `azd up`/auth flow;
the revised fixture still needs that live run before release. Pattern 25
separates functional CI results from cleanup reporting, not from safety.

### Example: Playwright MCP on ACA

For browser automation in Foundry (hosted agent containers cannot run browsers locally):

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.52.0-noble

RUN npm install -g @playwright/mcp

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npx", "@playwright/mcp", "--port", "8080"]
```

Deploy as ACA with external ingress on port 8080.

### Example: Custom Python MCP Server

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/python/server.py`](references/python/server.py). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the canonical FastMCP server with the `transport="streamable-http"` + `host="0.0.0.0"` + `port=os.environ["PORT"]` trio (closes M2 + M3) plus the `_helper()` pattern for sharing logic between two `@mcp.tool()` decorated functions.

The three lines this template prevents from going wrong: `transport="streamable-http"` (not bare `"http"`), `host="0.0.0.0"` (not stdio default), and `port=int(os.environ.get("PORT","8080"))` (ACA injects PORT). Plus: never call one `@mcp.tool()`-decorated function from inside another — extract shared logic into a plain `_helper()`.

---

## Bicep: ACA for MCP Server

> **MUST:** Copy verbatim from [`references/bicep/mcp-aca.bicep`](references/bicep/mcp-aca.bicep). Do NOT redefine inline — the validator enforces single-source-of-truth. That file is the canonical ACA module with external ingress on `:8080`, UAMI for ACR pull (A2), `transport: 'http'` (not deprecated `'auto'`), and liveness + startup probes on `/health` (without them, cold-start tool calls 502 until the first scrape). `minReplicas: 1` avoids the cold-start hit on every demo.

VNet injection is intentionally out of scope here — see `microsoft-foundry` SKILL for private topology. External ingress is required when the Foundry hosted agent (which runs in Foundry's infra, not your VNet) calls the MCP.

---

## Option D: Mock MCP Server (for Prototyping / Demo)

When backend systems are inaccessible (SAP, Oracle, corporate CRM, etc.), generate a
**FastMCP mock server** backed by sample data from `specs/sample-data/`. The customer
sees real MCP tool calls with realistic responses — and later swaps the endpoint URL
for their real system.

### How It Works

1. `threadlight-design` produces `specs/sample-data/{entity}.json` + tool contracts in spec § 6
2. This skill generates a FastMCP server with tools matching those contracts
3. Each tool reads from the sample data JSON files and returns matching records
4. Deploy to ACA (or run locally for dev) — agent connects via `mcp-config.json`
5. When real system available: customer deploys a real MCP server, changes the URL

### Generate `src/mcp/server.py`

For each tool contract in `specs/SPEC.md` § 6 that is backed by a system marked **mock**
in § 5, generate a tool function:

```python
"""Mock MCP server — auto-generated from SpecKit spec.
Replace with real system integration when available."""

import json
from pathlib import Path
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("mock-tools")

DATA_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "data"


def _load(entity: str) -> list:
    """Load sample data for an entity."""
    path = DATA_DIR / f"{entity}.json"
    if not path.exists():
        return []
    data = json.loads(path.read_text())
    return [r for r in data if not r.get("_meta")]


# === Auto-generated tools from spec § 6 ===
# Each tool matches a tool contract. Replace with real API calls when available.

@mcp.tool()
async def get_customer_profile(customer_id: str) -> str:
    """Look up customer profile. (Mock: reads from sample data)"""
    records = _load("customers")
    match = [r for r in records if r.get("customer_id") == customer_id]
    if match:
        return json.dumps(match[0], indent=2)
    return json.dumps({"error": "not_found", "customer_id": customer_id})


# ... generate one @mcp.tool() per tool contract backed by a mocked system ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

### Generate `src/mcp/data/`

Copy sample data from `specs/sample-data/*.json` into `src/mcp/data/`.

### Generate `src/mcp/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim

### Generate `src/mcp/requirements.txt`

```
fastmcp>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
azure-cosmos>=4.7.0          # only if Cosmos MCP — see Option A
azure-identity>=1.19.0       # only if keyless to Azure
aiohttp>=3.9.0               # MANDATORY for Cosmos MCP — async transport for azure-cosmos
```

### MCP ACA also needs the `fetch-container-image` pattern (just like bot)

> **Verified in recent ACA port-mismatch retrospectives.** When `infra/main.bicep`
> defaults the MCP image to `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest`
> (the standard "first-deploy" placeholder), the ACA gets stuck `InProgress` forever
> because the placeholder serves port 80 but the MCP module pins `targetPort: 8080`.
> The `fetch-container-image` pattern is documented for bot ACAs in `foundry-teams-bot`
> SKILL.md but **MUST be applied to MCP ACAs too.** Same trap, same fix:

```bicep
// infra/main.bicep — MCP ACA wiring
@description('Set true after the first azd deploy mcp; lets re-provision preserve the deployed image')
param mcpResourceExists bool = false

module fetchMcpImage 'mcp/fetch-container-image.bicep' = if (mcpResourceExists) {
  name: 'fetch-mcp-image'
  params: {
    name: 'ca-${prefix}-mcp-${token}'
  }
}

module mcp 'mcp/aca.bicep' = {
  params: {
    image: mcpResourceExists && !empty(fetchMcpImage.outputs.image)
      ? fetchMcpImage.outputs.image
      : 'mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/containerapps-helloworld:latest'
    targetPortOverride: mcpResourceExists ? 8080 : 80   // KEY: 80 on first deploy (helloworld), 8080 thereafter
    // ... rest of params
  }
}
```

The `fetch-container-image.bicep` shape is identical to the bot version
in `foundry-teams-bot/templates/infra/bot/fetch-container-image.bicep` —
copy it into `infra/mcp/` and adjust the resource type.

`threadlight-safe-check` will catch the helloworld placeholder if you
forget; see its `--phase post-deploy` image-probe step.

### Local Development

```bash
cd src/mcp
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
# MCP endpoint: http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

### Deploy to ACA

Use the standard `azd` workflow (see `azure.yaml` service binding in [`threadlight-deploy/references/azd-modules`](../threadlight-deploy/references/azd-modules/README.md)):

```bash
azd up   # provisions Bicep + builds image to ACR + patches ACA
```

### Swap to Real System

When the real system becomes available:
1. Deploy a real MCP server (see Options A–C above)
2. Update `mcp-config.json` URL from mock endpoint to real endpoint
3. Redeploy the agent (`azd deploy <service>`)
4. The tool contracts stay the same — only the backing implementation changes

## Securing your MCP server

For a delegated-only custom Entra API, use the separate
[foundry-mcp-auth candidate](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb/blob/7f1de882d5386e5a27852c91d3a89523eef218d0/skills/foundry-mcp-auth/SKILL.md). Its strict scope
policy and safe receipts do not change this skill's app-only defaults.
Issuer/audience validation alone is authentication, not per-user business
authorization. The candidate records the live-proven delegated paths and
keeps remaining multi-user and lifecycle gates explicit.

> **The perimeter is yours to build.** A public survey found only **8.5% of
> reachable MCP servers require OAuth** — the rest are unauthenticated remote
> tool-execution endpoints, i.e. open RCE. A remote MCP server with no identity
> check is not "internal-only by obscurity"; it is exploitable. This section
> hardens the ACA deployment above with Entra-validated auth **in front of** the
> container, managed identity for the hops behind it, and audit + input
> defenses on the tools themselves.
>
> **This skill uses ACA built-in authentication ("Easy Auth for Container
> Apps") — not Azure App Service.** The platform validates the caller's token
> before a request reaches your code. Reference:
> [Authentication and authorization in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/authentication).

### Threat model → defense mapping

| Threat | Mitigating layer | Where it lives |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Unauthenticated tool invocation (open RCE) | **L1** ACA built-in auth + `Return401` | `references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep` / `az containerapp auth` |
| Confused deputy — server replays the caller's token downstream | **L2** managed identity; never forward the inbound token | `references/python/secure_server.py` |
| Over-broad RBAC → lateral movement | **L2** one least-privilege role assignment | `references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep` |
| Secret exfiltration through a tool result | **L3** return secret *metadata*, never values; Key Vault refs | `references/python/secure_server.py` |
| Path traversal / command injection in tool args | **L3** allow-list inputs; reject `..` `/` `\` `;` `\|` `` ` `` `$(` | `references/python/secure_server.py` |
| Undetected abuse (invocation floods, probing) | **L5** one audit event per call → scheduled-query alert | `references/python/secure_server.py` + `microsoft-foundry` |

Defense-in-depth: skipping **L1** makes everything else moot; **L2–L5** keep a
breach from spreading.

### Layer 1 — Identity perimeter: ACA built-in auth

Put Entra in front of the container. ACA validates the JWT **before** it reaches
your app and injects a trusted `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL` header (base64 JSON the
client cannot forge). Anonymous calls get `401` — they never touch your tools.
Read that header **server-side** (FastMCP's `get_http_headers()` — see
[`secure_server.py`](references/python/secure_server.py)); never accept the
principal as a tool argument, which the client controls and can forge.

**One-time app registration** (defines the audience clients request a token for):

```bash
TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
APP_ID=$(az ad app create --display-name "mcp-server-auth" \
  --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --query appId -o tsv)
az ad sp create --id "$APP_ID"
# Expose api://<appId> as the resource callers request a token for:
az ad app update --id "$APP_ID" --identifier-uris "api://$APP_ID"
```

**Enable built-in auth + reject anonymous callers:**

```bash
az containerapp auth microsoft update -n <app> -g <rg> \
  --client-id "$APP_ID" \
  --issuer "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TENANT_ID/v2.0" \
  --allowed-token-audiences "api://$APP_ID" --yes
az containerapp auth update -n <app> -g <rg> \
  --unauthenticated-client-action Return401
```

> **⚠️ Audience-scoped only.** These two commands validate audience + issuer —
> an authentication check, not delegated scope or data authorization. Enforce
> the user's required `scp` permissions separately. The **app-only server-to-server**
> model (this skill's primary consumer) needs two more adjustments: see the
> callout below, or use the Bicep reference, which encodes both.

`Return401` is the API-server posture (reject), versus `RedirectToLoginPage`
(browser apps) or `AllowAnonymous` (pass everything through — never for a remote
MCP). The IaC-native equivalent — a `Microsoft.App/containerApps/authConfigs`
child resource, validation-only so it needs **no client secret** — is
[`references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep`](references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep).

> **App-only callers need explicit allow-listing — a mismatch is `403`, not
> `401`.** A server-to-server / MI bearer token (this skill's primary consumer
> model) clears the anonymous check but is still **denied `403`** unless its
> client id is in `defaultAuthorizationPolicy.allowedApplications`. Two more
> app-only quirks the reference Bicep encodes (all three verified against a live
> ACA Easy Auth deployment):
> - a **v2 app-only token's `aud` is the bare client GUID**, not `api://<appId>`
>   — list **both** forms in `allowedAudiences` so delegated *and* app-only
>   callers pass audience validation;
> - **authConfig readback is desired configuration, not loaded-policy proof.**
>   Compare an authenticated/unauthenticated probe on the actual route with the
>   selected config and revision. A stale response can have several causes.
>   Do not automatically restart, PATCH again or recreate; one authorized reload
>   is a discriminator only when the environment supports it, not a guaranteed
>   fix. A restart error alone does not identify the root cause.

**Caveat — no Dynamic Client Registration.** Entra does not implement DCR, so
interactive MCP clients must be **pre-registered**; ship a known client id
rather than expecting the client to self-register.

These options replace the old dev-only table:

| Option | When | Posture |
|--------|------|---------|
| Built-in auth + `Return401` (**recommended**) | Any reachable deployment | Entra-validated bearer |
| `AllowAnonymous` + a dev bypass flag | Local inner-loop only | No perimeter — never expose |

### Layer 2 — Managed identity and the confused-deputy rule

The server authenticates to Azure with its **own** managed identity, never the
caller's token. `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves `az login` locally and the
user-assigned MI in ACA — no secrets in code:

> **MUST:** downstream Azure access uses the server's MI. Copy the credential +
> secret-metadata pattern verbatim from
> [`references/python/secure_server.py`](references/python/secure_server.py).

**The confused-deputy rule:** the inbound token authorizes the caller to *your
server only*. Do **not** replay it to Cosmos, Key Vault, or another API. Use the
server's MI, or the On-Behalf-Of flow if you genuinely must act as the user.
Grant that MI exactly one role (e.g. `Key Vault Secrets User`) — the role
assignment is in
[`references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep`](references/bicep/mcp-aca-auth.bicep).

The `secret_status` reference currently calls `get_secret` and returns only
properties. That API/role can **read the value**; it is not a metadata-only
permission contract. If policy permits only metadata, stop before deployment
and select a reviewed metadata API/role instead. Do not grant Secrets User as
a silent fallback merely because the tool's returned payload omits the value.

### Layer 3 — Secret hygiene and tool-input defense

**Never return a secret value from a tool.** Return metadata (name, version,
enabled) so the model can reason about a secret without exfiltrating it; the
value reaches the runtime via a Key Vault reference
(`@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=...)`), not through the model. The
`secret_status` tool in `secure_server.py` shows the pattern.

**Reject unsafe tool inputs.** Any argument that becomes a path, key, or shell
fragment is a traversal/injection vector. The `safe_lookup` tool in
`secure_server.py` rejects `..`, `/`, `\`, `;`, `|`, `` ` ``, and `$(` before
use — reject-by-default beats sanitizing.

### Layer 4 — Network hardening

Easy Auth is an **identity** perimeter, not a **network** one. For regulated
workloads add, in order: private endpoints + VNET injection, then an APIM front
door running `validate-jwt` + `rate-limit-by-key`. The runtime-specific topology is
[`microsoft-foundry`](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-skills/tree/v1.2.77/.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry) — out of scope here.

**External ingress is not "unauthenticated."** The non-VNet default here uses
external ingress with Layer 1 authentication. Do not generalize that default
into a requirement for public access: app-level external ingress within an
internal ACA environment can serve private VNet callers. Prove each Foundry
runtime's actual route and DNS before using a private topology.

### Layer 5 — Audit and monitoring

Emit one structured audit line per tool call (caller, tool, decision). ACA ships
stdout to Log Analytics automatically, so a
[`microsoft-foundry`](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-skills/tree/v1.2.77/.github/plugins/azure-skills/skills/microsoft-foundry) scheduled-query
alert can fire on invocation spikes or repeated `denied` events. The
`audit_event` helper in `secure_server.py` is the emitter; upgrade to Azure
Monitor OpenTelemetry spans via `microsoft-foundry` when you want
distributed tracing.

### Connecting clients

| Client | How it authenticates | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Server-to-server** (Foundry agent, any service) | Its MI requests a token for `api://<appId>` and sends the bearer token | CI requires the standing `MCP_AUTH_APP_CLIENT_ID` audience and a distinct explicit caller ACL before deploying the MCP image; it checks anonymous 401, permitted 200, excluded-caller 403 and restored-policy 200 |
| **Interactive — manual bearer** (VS Code / Claude / Copilot) | Paste a token into the client's MCP config | Simplest interactive path |
| **Interactive — OAuth discovery** (advanced) | Server publishes PRM (RFC 9728); client follows `WWW-Authenticate` → user sign-in | Server's job on ACA — see below |

**Manual bearer** — a VS Code `.vscode/mcp.json` fragment:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "my-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://<aca-fqdn>/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${input:mcpToken}" }
    }
  }
}
```

Get the token with
`az account get-access-token --resource api://<appId> --query accessToken -o tsv`.

**OAuth discovery (advanced).** Unlike Azure App Service (whose preview platform
feature can auto-serve Protected Resource Metadata), **on ACA the MCP server
itself must publish PRM** at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728)
and emit a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge so a spec-compliant client can discover
the authorization server and run the flow. FastMCP's auth provider implements
this; see the
[MCP authorization spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization).
This path requires an interactive browser sign-in, so it is documented but not
CI-tested.

## Gotchas

> **🔴 DO NOT** use bare `MCP.run()` (defaults to stdio transport). On ACA, you MUST use `transport="streamable-http"` and bind to `0.0.0.0:8080`.

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| MCP tools not appearing in agent | Server returns 400/404 on protocol methods | Requests must return HTTP 200; notifications must return HTTP 202 |
| `logging/setLevel` returns -32601 Method not found | Server didn't implement the optional logging capability OR used wrong casing | Either implement the method per [MCP spec § Logging](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/utilities/logging) (camelCase `setLevel`) and declare `capabilities.logging`, or simply omit the capability — Foundry's MCP client tolerates servers that don't expose logging. |
| MCP connection timeout | ACA not started (cold start) | Runtime retries automatically; set `minReplicas: 1` for always-on |
| `invalid_payload` error | `${ENV_VAR}` in mcp-config.json not resolved → empty URL | Only include MCP servers with deployed endpoints. Remove entries with unresolved env vars. |
| Tools listed but calls fail | Tool call timeout (>100s) | Optimize tool implementation or increase ACA resources |
| **`FastMCP` server starts but returns 000/timeout on port** | `MCP.run()` with no args defaults to `stdio` transport (reads stdin, never binds HTTP port). ACA health probe fails, container marked unhealthy. | **🛑 DO NOT use bare `MCP.run()` on ACA — it defaults to stdio.** **DO use** `MCP.run(transport="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=int(os.environ.get("PORT", "8080")))`. Note: `transport="streamable-http"` (with the dash) matches the canonical examples elsewhere in this SKILL; the legacy bare `http` transport name is stale. |
| **`TypeError: 'FunctionTool' object is not callable` inside a tool** | `@MCP.tool` wraps the function in a `FunctionTool` object. Calling it from Python (e.g., tool A calls tool B internally) raises `TypeError`. | **Extract shared logic into a plain `_helper()` function. Both `@MCP.tool` functions call the helper. Never call one `@MCP.tool`-decorated function from inside another.** |
| **MCP ACA deployed but Foundry agent can't reach it (connection timeout)** | `az containerapp create --ingress internal` — only resources in the same VNET can reach it. Foundry hosted agents run in **Foundry's own infrastructure**, not your VNET. | **Use `--ingress external` for MCP ACA containers that Foundry agents call. Internal ingress only works for VNET-injected agents (private topology) where the agent subnet is peered/injected into the same VNET. See `microsoft-foundry`.** External ingress is safe when fronted by ACA built-in auth (see § Securing your MCP server → Layer 1); it is not the same as "unauthenticated." |
| `prompts/list` not implemented | Server doesn't handle this method | Return `{"prompts": []}` — agent-framework requires it |
| MCP `404` after session teardown | A late request may target the removed session; a 404 alone does not establish this cause | Retain the original session/request correlation and verify the completed work independently. Do not suppress unknown-session POST failures with a success-shaped 204 and do not replay business work to replace logs. |

---

## Failure Modes & Recovery (Consumer Config / Deployment Coupling)

| Symptom | Root cause | DO NOT do | DO instead |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Consumer config points to wrong URL (env var not resolved at deploy time) | `${MCP_SERVER_URL}` expands to empty at agent-startup time, not deployment time | **DO NOT use unguarded `${VAR}` substitution in mcp-config.json** — if the var is undefined, the agent skips the server silently | **DO guard with validation:** `if not url or not url.startswith("http"): raise ValueError(f"Invalid MCP URL: {url}")` in agent startup. Fail fast + audit-log. |
| Possible stale session after redeploy | Lost in-memory session is one candidate, not the meaning of every 404 | Do not replay the original tool or force a new agent version from a generic404 | Use a bounded read/handshake discriminator; retain original IDs and reconcile any effect before explicitly authorized recovery. A show command does not refresh runtime configuration. |
| Wrong mount path (404 on MCP calls) | FastMCP 3.x serves on `/mcp/` with trailing slash; consumer config or curl tests use `/` without slash | **DO NOT assume FastMCP mount path** — it changed between 2.x and 3.x; don't infer from version. Test explicitly. | **DO test with `curl https://<aca-fqdn>/mcp/ -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream"` (note trailing slash).** Returns `200 OK` if path is correct. For local: `curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/`. |
| MCP call returns `401` after enabling built-in auth | Caller sent no token, or a token for the wrong resource | DO NOT switch to `AllowAnonymous` to "make it work" — that deletes the perimeter | Send `Authorization: Bearer $(az account get-access-token --resource api://<appId> --query accessToken -o tsv)`; confirm the token `aud` equals `api://<appId>` |
| `401` even with a token attached | `allowedAudiences` / issuer mismatch, or a Graph token | DO NOT paste a Microsoft Graph token (`--resource https://graph.microsoft.com`) | Request the token for `api://<appId>`; verify `--allowed-token-audiences` includes exactly that value and issuer is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0` |

## Mock Data Generation — Delegate to `threadlight-demo-data-factory`

**Important**: The Mock MCP Server (Option D above) describes the **MCP shell**
— how to wrap mocked systems behind the protocol. **It does NOT generate the
realistic sample data itself.** Data generation is the responsibility of the
`threadlight-demo-data-factory` skill.

### Division of labor

| Layer | Skill | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **What data should look like** (industry rules, golden cases, distributions) | `threadlight-design` (`references/data-realism/<industry>.md`) | Markdown rules per industry |
| **How data is generated** (Faker generators, seeding, reset, scripts) | `threadlight-demo-data-factory` | `src/agent/data/seed.py` + scripts |
| **How tools wrap the data** (MCP protocol, JSON-RPC, tool contracts) | `threadlight-mcp-aca` (this skill) | `src/mcp/server.py` + Dockerfile + ACA Bicep |

### Workflow when the spec marks a system as `mock`

```
SPEC § 5 says system X is "mock"
    │
    ├── threadlight-design § 11d defines the data shape (volumes, golden cases, industry rules)
    │
    ├── threadlight-demo-data-factory generates src/agent/data/*.json
    │       (Faker + per-industry generator + seeded RNG + Cosmos seed/reset scripts)
    │
    └── threadlight-mcp-aca (this skill) generates src/mcp/server.py
            that READS src/agent/data/*.json AND/OR queries Cosmos (seeded by the factory)
            and exposes the spec § 6 tool contracts via MCP
```

The `src/mcp/data/` directory described in Option D §
"Generate `src/mcp/data/`" is **populated by `threadlight-demo-data-factory`,
not by this skill**. The script copying step in Option D should be replaced
with a call to the factory:

```bash
# Old (manual): cp specs/sample-data/*.json src/mcp/data/
# New (skill-driven):
uv run scripts/seed_data.py --to src/mcp/data/   # threadlight-demo-data-factory
```

## Validate-or-reject (the canonical pattern for stateful tools)

> **Highest-leverage pattern in the toolchain.** Observed in real deployments:
> lifted recommendation quality from "junk packet
> with `confidence: 0`" to "well-cited `confidence: 0.93` packet" with
> a single server-side change. Apply this to **every** MCP tool that
> commits a decision, persists state, or returns a high-stakes
> artifact (recommendation, approval, payment, allocation, contract).

### The failure mode this fixes

When a hosted agent runs a long instruction chain (10+ steps), even
strong models occasionally call a "build the answer" tool **before**
calling the evidence-gathering tools. With a permissive server, this
returns a hollow object — no transactions, no merchant lookup, no rule
citations — and the agent confidently emits it as the final answer.

The most reliable fix is **NOT** to add more text to the agent's
instructions ("ALWAYS call X before Y"). It's to make the server
**physically incapable** of producing a hollow answer.

### The pattern

Every commit-style tool validates that its `evidence_bundle` (or
equivalent input) contains the required fields. If anything is missing,
return a structured error with a `next_steps` array that names exactly
which tools to call. The agent reads this and self-corrects on the
next iteration.

```python
# src/mcp/server.py — applies to ANY commit-style tool
@mcp.tool()
async def build_recommendation(
    case_id: str,
    evidence_bundle: dict,   # the agent assembles this from prior tool calls
) -> str:
    """Build the final recommendation packet. REQUIRES complete evidence."""

    REQUIRED = {
        "transactions": "get_transaction_history",
        "merchant_profile": "get_merchant_profile",
        "prior_cases": "search_prior_cases",
        "rule_citations": "lookup_reg_rule + lookup_network_rule",
    }

    missing = []
    for field, source_tool in REQUIRED.items():
        v = evidence_bundle.get(field)
        if not v or (isinstance(v, list) and len(v) == 0):
            missing.append({"field": field, "call_tool": source_tool})

    if missing:
        return json.dumps({
            "error": "INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE",
            "case_id": case_id,
            "missing": missing,
            "next_steps": [
                f"Call `{m['call_tool']}` to populate evidence_bundle.{m['field']}"
                for m in missing
            ],
            "guidance": (
                "Do not retry build_recommendation until every "
                "missing field is populated."
            ),
        }, indent=2)

    # ... real recommendation construction here ...
    return json.dumps(packet, indent=2)
```

### What good looks like (acceptance criteria)

| Test | Expected |
|------|----------|
| Call commit-tool with empty `evidence_bundle` | Returns `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` with full `missing` + `next_steps` (HTTP 200, error in payload — never raise) |
| Call commit-tool with partial evidence | Returns `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` listing only the missing fields |
| Call commit-tool with complete evidence | Returns the real packet |
| Smoke test on the agent end-to-end | Agent never emits a hollow packet — when it tries, it self-corrects within 1-2 extra tool calls |

### Why structured (`error` + `missing` + `next_steps`), not free-form

A free-form `"please call get_transaction_history first"` works *some*
of the time. The structured shape is the difference between "works
high and low reproducibility in recent strict-smoke runs. Models
parse structured payloads more reliably than English instructions in
tool outputs.

### Severity & error semantics

- Domain validation failures use a structured tool error. Do not suppress
  authentication/transport failures or infer that every client retries them.
  Measure dispatch behavior for the pinned client. An uncertain write is not
  safely retryable merely because a domain error can be rendered as JSON.
- Use a stable `error` enum (`INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`, `NOT_FOUND`,
  `STATE_CONFLICT`, etc.) so the agent can pattern-match.
- `next_steps` MUST name the exact tool name the agent has access to —
  do not write "go look it up", write `"Call \`get_transaction_history\`
  with customer_id=…"`.

### When NOT to apply this pattern

- Pure-read tools (`get_transaction_history`, `lookup_*`) — no state,
  no commit, no need to gate.
- Trivial tools that take only the inputs they validate (e.g.,
  `compute_business_days(start, end)`) — there's nothing to gate
  against.
- Tools whose entire purpose IS to fail-fast on missing args (the
  validation IS the answer).

### Cross-reference

This pattern combines with `threadlight-design` SPEC § 6 tool contracts:
each commit-style tool's contract should explicitly enumerate its
required `evidence_bundle` fields and the `error` enums it can return.
The MCP server then mirrors those contracts as the validate-or-reject
guard above.

## Streaming & Webhook Primitives (for live-event MCP servers)

Some processes (Order Fallout, Network Fault, Supplier Risk news ingestion)
need MCP tools that return **streaming live data** rather than read-once
records. Two patterns:

### Pattern 1 — `tools/call` with progressive notifications

For long-running tools that should stream partial results (e.g., "scanning
1247 orders for fallout matches"):

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def scan_fallout_orders(ctx: Context) -> dict:
    total = 1247
    for i, order in enumerate(orders):
        await ctx.report_progress(i, total, f"Scanning {order['order_id']}")
        if matches_fallout_pattern(order):
            yield order  # streaming chunk
    return {"scanned": total, "matched": match_count}
```

The agent receives `progress` notifications via JSON-RPC and can render
them in the workspace UI.

### Pattern 2 — webhook-fed MCP server

For event-driven sources (Service Bus, Event Grid), pair this skill with

     └── normalizes payload, dedups, writes to backing store
```

The receiver scaffold (from `threadlight-event-triggers`) ingests and
normalizes; this skill's MCP server reads from the backing store and exposes
it through tool contracts. **Do not poll external APIs from inside the MCP
server** — it makes the agent slow and breaks the 100-second tool timeout.

## Reset & Replay Scripts

Reset applies only to explicitly approved synthetic run-owned data. It is not
reconciliation of a lost response, and must never erase unresolved effect
evidence or reset a real business system to make a test pass.

Every MCP server backed by a mocked system MUST ship two scripts so demos
recover from failed runs in <30s:

### `scripts/seed_mcp.py`

Idempotent. Loads `src/agent/data/*.json` (generated by
`threadlight-demo-data-factory`) into the MCP backing store (in-memory cache
or Cosmos seeding). Safe to call repeatedly.

### `scripts/reset_mcp.py`

Wipes any state the agent has mutated (case statuses moved, decisions
recorded) and re-seeds. The agent does NOT need to be restarted — the MCP
server re-reads on next tool call.

```python
# scripts/reset_mcp.py — typical shape
async def reset():
    await wipe_mutable_state()        # agent-driven changes
    await seed_baseline()             # factory-generated data
    await mark_reset(timestamp=now()) # surface in workspace UI

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(reset())
    print("MCP reset complete.")
```

The reset endpoint MAY also be exposed as an HTTP route on the MCP server
(`POST /admin/reset`) for one-click reset from the workspace UI — but
ONLY in dev/demo environments. Gate behind `DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=true`.

| **SPEC.md § 5b External Systems & Mocks** | `threadlight-design` — per-system MCP shape and tool list |
| **SPEC.md § 6 Tool Contracts** | `threadlight-design` — exact tool signatures the MCP server must expose |
| `src/agent/data/*.json` | `threadlight-demo-data-factory` — pre-generated sample data |
| **SPEC.md § 10b Triggers** | `threadlight-design` — tells you whether to also wire an event receiver (delegated to `threadlight-event-triggers`) |

| Produces | At |
|----------|-----|
| `src/mcp/server.py` | One MCP server per mocked system |
| `src/mcp/Dockerfile` | Build artifact for ACA |
| `src/mcp/requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | Python deps |
| `infra/modules/aca-mcp.bicep` | ACA module — composed by `threadlight-deploy` (delegates to `threadlight-deploy/references/azd-modules` Bicep library) |
| `scripts/seed_mcp.py` | Idempotent reseed |
| `scripts/reset_mcp.py` | Demo recovery (<30s) |
| `mcp-config.json` entry | Wired into `src/agent/mcp-config.json` so the hosted agent can discover the MCP server |
