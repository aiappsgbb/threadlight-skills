    Wrapper around the MAF Python SDK (Agent + SkillsProvider + @tool) plus
    Streamlit as the Pattern 0 Quickstart UI runtime. Version-pinned, no git
    SHA tracking. The skill ships its own reference package under
    references/quickstart/ — this pin guards the SDK surface that package
    targets.

packages:
  - name: agent-framework
    source: pypi
    version: "1.4.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/agent-framework/#history
    notes: |
      MAF surface used by Pattern 0 wiring: Agent, SkillsProvider.from_paths,
      @tool decorator. Same pin family as foundry-hosted-agents to keep the
      Pattern 0 → prod-deploy ergonomic story consistent.
  - name: streamlit
    source: pypi
    version: "1.40.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/streamlit/#history
    notes: |
      Pattern 0 chat UI runtime. Caps at 1.40.x — Streamlit minors land
      breaking renderer changes more often than MAF does, and the demo UI
      relies on st.chat_message + st.chat_input which became stable in 1.30.
  - name: azure-identity
    source: pypi
    version: "1.21.0"
    upstream_changelog: https://pypi.org/project/azure-identity/#history
    notes: |
      DefaultAzureCredential for FoundryChatClient + AzureOpenAIChatClient.
      Same surface as every other skill in the catalog.

# Upstream pin — `threadlight-local-test` skill

This Tier-B pin captures the PyPI dependency surface that the Pattern 0
Quickstart reference package under `references/quickstart/` targets.

## Pinned packages

| Package | Source | Pinned version | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------------|-------|
| `agent-framework` | PyPI | **1.9.0** | MAF `Agent` + `SkillsProvider.from_paths` + `@tool` surface used by Pattern 0 |
| `streamlit` | PyPI | **1.40.0** | Pattern 0 chat UI; pinned to a minor that has stable `st.chat_message` / `st.chat_input` |
| `azure-identity` | PyPI | **1.21.0** | `DefaultAzureCredential` for both Foundry and AOAI backends |

## Verification checklist

Run the `validation.script` front-matter block. Expected output contains
`ok agent-framework surface` AND `ok streamlit chat surface`. When the
reference package is on disk (i.e. the runner cloned the catalog), the
script also runs `python -m threadlight_quickstart --check --root <fixture>`
end-to-end against `fixture-poc`.

## Why these caps

- **`agent-framework ~=1.9.0`** — Pattern 0 uses the same wiring shape
  (`Agent + SkillsProvider`) documented in `foundry-hosted-agents` for prod
  deploy. Keeping the cap consistent across skills means the
  design → quickstart → deploy ergonomic story doesn't bifurcate.
- **`streamlit ~=1.40.0`** — Streamlit's minor releases land renderer
  breaking changes more often than its semver suggests; the cap keeps the
  Pattern 0 chat UI deterministic until we ship a refresh PR.
- **`azure-identity ~=1.21.0`** — same surface every other skill in the
  catalog uses; refresh in lock-step with the rest.

## Known issues

None at this pin.
