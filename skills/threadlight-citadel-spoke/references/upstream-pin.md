    This pin shares the hub's exact source revision. Consumed interfaces were
    compared with both previous spoke pins; validation is source/file based,
    not live hub/spoke, JWT or Foundry runtime acceptance.

# Upstream pin — `threadlight-citadel-spoke` skill

This file is the **machine-readable validation contract** for the
`threadlight-citadel-spoke` skill. The YAML front-matter above is parsed by
`scripts/check-freshness.py` weekly; the prose below is the human audit trail.
Keep them in sync.

---

## 1. Pin

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Upstream** | `Azure-Samples/ai-hub-gateway-solution-accelerator` |
| **Branch / tag** | `citadel-v1` |
| **Pinned SHA** | `63f0f812474e713916dc909494d655246783a1d9` |
| **Pinned commit subject** | `Merge pull request #152 from mohamedsaif/citadel-v1` |
| **License** | `MIT` |
| **First authored against** | `2026-05-15` |
| **Last source re-validation** | `2026-09-17`; not live acceptance |

Refresh procedure:
```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-hub-gateway-solution-accelerator citadel-v1
# Compare first column to pinned_sha in front-matter
```

---

## 2. Pinned packages (Tier B / mixed only)

No package is pinned for this Tier-A wrapper. Validation reads Access Contract
source files and public GitHub docs only.

---

## 3. Verification checklist (the executable contract)

Run the frontmatter's `validation.script` verbatim; it is the single executable
definition. It materializes the declared SHA, not the moving branch. Branch
freshness still belongs to the freshness detector; branch drift does not change
the source being validated.

**Expected output** must contain (substring match):

- `pinned source checkout ok`
- `access contract schema ok`
- `policy docs link check ok`

**Failure signatures** (treat as upstream regression — report distinctly):

- None.

---

## 4. Source comparison and acceptance boundary

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Exact pinned source | ✅ | `pinned source checkout ok` |
| Access Contract schema | ✅ | `access contract schema ok` |
| Policy docs | ✅ | `policy docs link check ok` |

The prior `08294f09a70833e282776a07fe7f97a6aead55b1` and
`6820ddb822730162858dfd6dc30eaab9e811a062` are both ancestors of the selected
hub pin, not newer fixes being rolled back. Their consumed Access Contract /
standalone Foundry integration trees are byte-identical to each other.
The comparison from `6820ddb` to `63f0f81` found:

| Consumed surface | Source delta |
|---|---|
| `modules/foundryConnection.bicep`, `foundry-integration/` | Unchanged. Connection auth remains ApiKey; category, target, discovery/auth metadata contract retained. |
| `main.bicep` / `main.bicepparam` | Existing input names and primary product/connection naming retained. Optional multi-gateway and key-rotation inputs/outputs added. Defaults use the primary gateway/key; rotation is disabled. |
| `modules/apimOnboardService.bicep` | Product/API association and `scope: product.id` retained. Optional rotation inputs and secondary/active-key outputs added; existing primary-key output remains. |
| Default LLM policy | Allowed models narrowed from `gpt-4o,deepseek-r1,gpt-4.1,gpt-5.4-mini` to `gpt-4.1,gpt-5.4-mini`. Review selected models; never overwrite an approved deployed policy automatically. |
| TOOL/AGENT/MULTI defaults | New asset-aware default policy; not equivalent to the LLM-only path and not accepted by this source comparison. |

This is source compatibility review of the documented LLM path, **not a live
compatibility claim**. The hub pin's lean gateway evidence and blocked positive
JWT test remain separate. The dated adoption status below records the later
probe execution without implying Hosted runtime or JWT acceptance.

### Adoption status — 2026-09-17

The designated owner executed the canonical probe against an existing approved
APIM from **09:35:14.539855 to 09:35:19.515289 UTC**, using native
`AzureCliCredential` in the approved paired tenant-isolated context. Native SDK
versions were `azure-mgmt-apimanagement` **5.0.0**, `azure-mgmt-resource`
**23.1.1**, and `azure-identity` **1.25.3**.

| Acceptance surface | Source-bound outcome |
|---|---|
| U3 HUB_INVENTORY positive | Existing exact API/product/active scoped subscription: all three booleans true; `hub_contract_status=ok`; Foundry remains `unverified`. |
| U3 HUB_INVENTORY negative | Existing unassociated API against the same product: API true, product/subscription false; `hub_contract_status=missing`. Native association HEAD independently returned HTTP 404; Foundry remains `unverified`. |
| U2 HOSTED_GATEWAY_ROUTE | **NOT TESTED**: the authorization covered hub metadata only, not a model invocation. |
| DOWNSTREAM_JWT | **NOT TESTED**: no inference, keys or new credentials. Connection-managed ApiKey custody is not downstream JWT proof. |
| CLEANUP | **NOT NEEDED**: zero resources, data or access settings created or modified. |

The helper's SHA-256 was verified before and after execution:
`c6de8d1dbdfa7a9edfd5e6facf8eb75ff5ade7a623a8565a02b4721757d9dcfe`.
It matches the implementation committed in
[`652bc158`](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb/commit/652bc1587cdfad041f6d49d5a1acda1318061ff8).
Sanitized receipt SHA-256:
`3191f175305b463068035b0910995eb0b0330404fdab25c1412ce72756f625e0`.
The [PR evidence](https://github.com/aiappsgbb/awesome-gbb/pull/507) records the
bounded execution; raw target IDs, policy XML and private evidence stay private.
No key/secret retrieval, configuration change, grant or model call occurred.

The frontmatter's `validation.script` remains **source-only T1**, not this live
execution. Wrong-scope returned data, misleading subscription names, failed
pagination and 403 are additional offline native-SDK regressions, not extra
live outcomes. This dated probe result does not certify a hub deployment,
Hosted gateway route, private runtime path, effective policy or governed action.

## 5. Known issues at this pin

No known issues are tracked for this pin.

## 6. Re-pin procedure

When upstream advances:

1. **Capture new SHA**:
   ```bash
   git ls-remote https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-hub-gateway-solution-accelerator citadel-v1
   ```
2. **Update front-matter** with the new SHA and commit subject.
3. **Run the validation script**:
   ```bash
   PINNED_SHA=<new-sha> bash -c "$(yq '.validation.script' upstream-pin.md)"
   ```
4. **Verify expected output** from § 3.
5. **Update audit trail**.
6. **Bump SKILL.md `metadata.version` PATCH** per AGENTS.md § 5.
7. **Open PR** touching only this file and `SKILL.md`.

## 9. Notes for the coding agent

> **If you're GHCP picking up a refresh issue for this skill:**
>
> 1. Run `validation.script`; it performs no live Azure, APIM, or Foundry calls.
> 2. If it passes, update the pin and PATCH-bump `SKILL.md` only.
> 3. If it fails, comment with the failure output and do **not** open a PR.
> 4. Never edit `references/data-realism/**`.
