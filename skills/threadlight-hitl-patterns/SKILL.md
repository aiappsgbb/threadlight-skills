# Threadlight HITL Patterns

Generate **Teams Adaptive Cards** + bot integration for the seven canonical
action gates declared in `specs/SPEC.md` § 8 Human Interaction Points.

> **Why a separate skill from `foundry-teams-bot`?** `foundry-teams-bot`
> handles the bot **infrastructure** (manifest, ACA, UAMI, MsalConnectionManager,
> messaging extension routing). This skill handles the **gate UX** — the
> Adaptive Card content, the Action.Submit handlers, the audit-trail wiring.
> One bot, many gates; the bot doesn't know what the gates mean.

## When to Use

- Process spec § 8 declares one or more action gates
- Process needs human approval/escalation/signoff in Teams
- Edit-and-approve flow (operator can amend the agent's proposal before approving)

## When NOT to Use

- Process is fully autonomous (no § 8)
- Operator works in a workspace UI only (use `threadlight-workspace-ui`);
  but note that a workspace can still embed action gates locally

---

## Input contract / Output artifacts

**Input contract**:

- `specs/SPEC.md` § 8 — for each interaction:
  - `Action gate`: one of the seven canonical gates (see below)
  - `Linked business rules` (BR-XXX list)
  - `Data Presented`: which fields the human sees
  - `Options`: what actions the human can take
  - `Timeout/SLA`: how long before escalation
- `specs/SPEC.md` § 4 — entity field schemas (for the card data binding)
- `AGENTS.md` — for the agent identity that calls the gate

**Output**:

```

> **next to the existing use-case skills** so it travels with the same bundle.
> If the export has no `specs/SPEC.md` § 8, take the gate type + linked fields
> from the operator (or infer from `use-cases/<x>/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) instead of

## The seven canonical gates

Aligned with the action-gate taxonomy in `threadlight-design` SPEC § 8.

### 1. `approve` — yes/no

**When**: agent proposes a low-risk action; human confirms.

**Card shape**: Title + summary card + two buttons (`Approve` / `Decline`).

```jsonc
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.5",
  "body": [
    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "${title}", "size": "large", "weight": "bolder"},
    {"type": "FactSet", "facts": "${summaryFacts}"},
    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "Linked rules: ${linkedRules}", "isSubtle": true, "size": "small"}
  ],
  "actions": [
    {"type": "Action.Submit", "title": "Approve", "data": {"gate": "approve", "decision": "approved", "case_id": "${caseId}"}, "style": "positive"},
    {"type": "Action.Submit", "title": "Decline", "data": {"gate": "approve", "decision": "declined", "case_id": "${caseId}"}, "style": "destructive"}
  ]
}
```

**Audit fields written**: `gate=approve`, `decision`, `case_id`, `actor`, `timestamp`,
`linked_rules`, `agent_proposal_summary`.

### 2. `edit-and-approve` — amend before commit

**When**: agent's proposal is mostly right but the human may want to tweak
fields before committing.

**Card shape**: editable Input fields prefilled with agent's proposal +
`Approve as edited` and `Cancel`.

```jsonc
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.5",
  "body": [
    {"type": "TextBlock", "text": "${title}", "size": "large", "weight": "bolder"},
    {"type": "Input.Text", "id": "field1", "label": "Field 1", "value": "${proposed.field1}"},
    {"type": "Input.ChoiceSet", "id": "field2", "label": "Field 2", "value": "${proposed.field2}", "choices": "${field2Choices}"},
    {"type": "Input.Text", "id": "rationale", "label": "Why edit?", "isMultiline": true}
  ],
  "actions": [
    {"type": "Action.Submit", "title": "Approve as edited", "data": {"gate": "edit-and-approve", "case_id": "${caseId}"}, "style": "positive"},
    {"type": "Action.Submit", "title": "Cancel", "data": {"gate": "edit-and-approve", "decision": "cancelled", "case_id": "${caseId}"}}
  ]
}
```

**Audit fields**: includes `proposed_diff` (the delta between agent proposal
and human-edited values) for traceability.

### 3. `reject` — refuse with reason

**When**: human declines and must record why (regulatory or quality reasons).

**Card shape**: reason picker (ChoiceSet from the linked rules) + free-text +
single `Reject` button.

### 4. `escalate` — route to higher authority

**When**: case exceeds the human's authority; routes to a queue or named role.

**Card shape**: role/queue picker + reason + `Escalate` button. After submit,
post a NEW card to the escalation target.

### 5. `signoff` — attest review (no veto)

**When**: regulator requires human attestation but human has no veto power
(read-and-acknowledge).

**Card shape**: full case detail + `I have reviewed and acknowledge` single
button. Records signature trail (actor + timestamp + content hash).

### 6. `audit-view` — read-only inspection

**When**: human (auditor, compliance) inspects a case without taking action.

**Card shape**: full case detail with NO action buttons. Generates an audit
event ("viewed by X at T") for compliance.

### 7. `request-info` — ask for more data

**When**: agent can't proceed without more input from the customer or an
external party.

**Card shape**: templated message composer (subject + body, optionally with
attachment slots). Submit posts the templated message via the configured
channel (Teams chat, email via Logic App, etc.).

---

## Generation procedure

### Step 1: Walk spec § 8

For each interaction:

```python
gate = interaction["action_gate"]
linked_rules = interaction["linked_business_rules"]
fields = interaction["data_presented"]
sla = interaction["timeout_sla"]
```

### Step 2: Generate the card template

- Pick the canonical card shape from this skill's `references/cards/{gate}.json`
- Substitute `${title}`, `${summaryFacts}`, `${linkedRules}`, etc. with spec data
- For `edit-and-approve`: generate Input fields from the entity schema in spec § 4
- For `escalate`: derive the role list from the AGENTS.md skill actor table

### Step 3: Generate the handler

Generate `src/bot/cards/{gate}_handler.py` with the **canonical handler
contract** (matches what `card_router.route()` invokes — see Step 4).

```python
# {gate}_handler.py
from botbuilder.core import TurnContext
from botbuilder.schema import Activity

async def handle(turn_context: TurnContext,
                 activity: Activity,
                 value: dict) -> Activity | None:
    """Handle Action.Submit for the {gate} gate.

    Args:
        turn_context: Bot Framework turn context (for replying / continuing).
        activity:     Original Action.Submit activity (for actor / channel data).
        value:        activity.value parsed dict (gate, case_id, decision, edits, ...).

    Returns:
        Activity to send back as the card update, or None if no update needed
        (e.g. handler queued an async escalation and will reply later).
    """
    case_id = value["case_id"]            # spec § 8 mandates case_id round-trip
    actor = _actor_from(turn_context)     # Easy Auth / Bot Framework identity
    # 1. Load the case from Cosmos (via MCP tool call or direct SDK with UAMI)
    # 2. Apply the gate decision (write back to Cosmos, fire downstream action)
    # 3. Write audit trail (gate, decision, actor, timestamp, linked_rules, ...)
    # 4. Return updated card (success or error message)
    raise NotImplementedError
```

> The handler signature is **stable** across all gates (`approve`,
> `edit-and-approve`, `reject`, `escalate`, `signoff`, `audit-view`,
> `request-info`) so the router stays simple.

### Step 4: Wire into the bot

Update `src/bot/cards/card_router.py` to map gate names to handlers:

```python
import importlib
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

HANDLERS = {
    "approve":          "skills.kyc_decision.cards.approve_handler",
    "edit-and-approve": "skills.kyc_decision.cards.edit_and_approve_handler",
    "reject":           "skills.kyc_decision.cards.reject_handler",
    "escalate":         "skills.kyc_decision.cards.escalate_handler",
    "signoff":          "skills.kyc_decision.cards.signoff_handler",
    "audit-view":       "skills.kyc_decision.cards.audit_view_handler",
    "request-info":     "skills.kyc_decision.cards.request_info_handler",
}

async def route(turn_context, activity):
    value = activity.value or {}
    gate = value.get("gate")
    if not gate or gate not in HANDLERS:
        return error_card("unknown-gate", details=f"Got {gate!r}")
    try:
        handler = importlib.import_module(HANDLERS[gate]).handle
    except (ImportError, AttributeError) as e:
        log.exception("Handler import failed for gate=%s", gate)
        return error_card("handler-unavailable", details=str(e))
    return await handler(turn_context, activity, value)
```

`error_card(code, details=None)` is a small helper that builds an
Adaptive Card with a short red-banner error message and a "Try again"
button — define it once in `src/bot/cards/_error.py` and import.

### Step 5: Generate the audit-trail writer

`src/bot/cards/audit_trail.py` writes every gate outcome to Cosmos with
this schema:

```json
{
  "id": "audit-{case_id}-{gate}-{activity_id}",
  "case_id": "...",
  "gate": "approve | edit-and-approve | reject | escalate | signoff | audit-view | request-info",
  "decision": "approved | declined | cancelled | escalated_to | acknowledged | viewed | requested",
  "actor": {"upn": "...", "displayName": "..."},
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
  "linked_rules": ["BR-001", "BR-007"],
  "agent_proposal": {...},
  "human_edits": {...},     // only for edit-and-approve
  "rationale": "..."        // only for reject / edit-and-approve
}
```

> **Deterministic id, not `uuid4`.** The `id` is composed from the case
> id, the gate name, and the source `activity.id` from Bot Framework.
> This makes the write **idempotent** under Bot Framework retries (Teams
> is at-least-once for outgoing card submissions when the bot times out)
> — a duplicate Action.Submit collapses into a single audit row instead
> of double-booking the case. Pair with `upsert_item` not `create_item`.

**Keyless Cosmos pattern (mandatory for threadlight pilots):**

```python
# src/bot/cards/audit_trail.py
import os
from azure.cosmos.aio import CosmosClient
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

# Module-level singletons — created once at bot startup, reused for the
# bot's lifetime. Re-creating CosmosClient per request is a known cause
# of socket exhaustion under load (Cosmos SDK opens up to 100 sockets
# per client; reuse keeps it bounded).
_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
_client = CosmosClient(url=os.environ["COSMOS_ENDPOINT"], credential=_credential)
_container = (
    _client.get_database_client(os.environ["COSMOS_DB"])
           .get_container_client("case_audit")
)

async def write_audit(record: dict) -> None:
    # Deterministic id: see audit-schema.md for the rationale.
    # upsert is idempotent under Bot Framework retries.
    await _container.upsert_item(body=record)

async def aclose() -> None:
    """Call from bot shutdown hook to release sockets cleanly."""
    await _client.close()
    await _credential.close()
```

> **Keyless RBAC pin**: assign `Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor`
> (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`) to the bot's UAMI on the Cosmos
> account scope. **NOT** `DocumentDB Account Contributor` — that's
> control-plane only. See `azd-patterns` § Shared UAMI for the Bicep wiring.
> Verify with `az cosmosdb sql role assignment list --account-name <acct>
> --resource-group <rg>` after deploy.

This audit trail powers:
- The workspace UI's audit viewer (see `threadlight-workspace-ui`)
- The continuous-eval KPIs (see `foundry-evals` continuous loop)
- Regulator-facing reports (compliance team queries Cosmos directly)

### Step 6: SLA timeouts

For gates with a `Timeout/SLA` in spec § 8:

- Generate a scheduled ACA job (via `threadlight-event-triggers`) that scans
  for un-acted-on cases past their SLA
- The job posts an `escalate` card to the escalation target
- Records a "SLA breach" audit event

---

## Card content rules

- **One card = one decision.** Don't bundle approve+edit+reject in one card.
- **Always show linked BR-XXX.** Auditor needs to see which rules drive
  this decision point.
- **Never include free-form chat in an action card.** That's a different
  surface (chat inside Teams).
- **Always include case-id.** The handler needs to round-trip it.
- **Use Adaptive Cards 1.5+.** v1.5 adds `carouselPage`, table layout,
  `Action.Execute` with refresh, and `targetWidth` responsive overrides
  that we depend on for the workspace UI's adaptive width. Teams supports
  v1.5 in current desktop / mobile / web clients.

---

## SLA + escalation pattern

Gates with SLAs need a follow-up watcher:

```
spec § 8 says: "Approve within 4h, otherwise escalate to manager"
       ↓
ACA Job (cron `*/15 * * * *` — every 15 minutes): scan Cosmos for cases where:
  status='awaiting_approval' AND created_at < now() - 4h
       ↓
For each match:
  1. Write audit event "SLA breach"
  2. Post `escalate` card to manager (using the same gate plumbing)
  3. Mark case as 'escalated'
```

The watcher is generated by `threadlight-event-triggers` based on the SLA
declarations harvested by this skill.

## Reference files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `references/cards/README.md` | Per-gate card schemas (one section per gate, embedded) | shipped |
| `references/audit-schema.md` | Full audit-trail JSON schema + deterministic-id rationale | shipped |

> Card templates and SLA-watcher wiring details live inside the two files
> above (one consolidated reference per concern keeps the templates in
> sync with the gate-vocabulary changes documented in
> `threadlight-design/references/speckit-template.md` § 8). SLA-watcher
> Bicep + cron wiring is generated by `threadlight-event-triggers` and
> consumes only the SLA fields written by this skill — there is no
> separate `sla-watchers.md` reference.

---

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ **Don't put business logic in the card.** Cards are display + intent
  capture. Logic lives in the handler module.
- ❌ **Don't skip audit trail** — even for `audit-view` (the act of viewing
  is itself auditable).
- ❌ **Don't reuse one card for multiple gates** — each gate has different
  field requirements and audit semantics.
- ❌ **Don't ship without SLA watcher** when spec § 8 declares an SLA. A
  card without a watcher is a card that silently misses its deadline.
- ❌ **Don't hardcode actor lists for `escalate`** — read them from
  AGENTS.md or a config file so they evolve with the org.
