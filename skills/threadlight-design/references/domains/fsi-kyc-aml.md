# Domain Primer: Financial Services — KYC / AML

> Use this primer when the user mentions: KYC, AML, customer onboarding (banking/FSI),
> due diligence, sanctions screening, PEP, SAR, compliance onboarding, anti-money laundering,
> know your customer, customer identification program (CIP).

## Regulatory Landscape

| Regulation | Jurisdiction | Key Requirements |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)** | US | Customer Identification Program (CIP), SAR filing, CTR reporting |
| **USA PATRIOT Act** | US | Enhanced due diligence for higher-risk customers, Section 314 information sharing |
| **EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives (AMLD 4/5/6)** | EU | Risk-based approach, beneficial ownership registers, PEP screening |
| **FATF Recommendations** | Global | 40 Recommendations on AML/CFT, risk-based approach, customer due diligence |
| **FinCEN regulations** | US | SAR/CTR filing thresholds, recordkeeping requirements |
| **GDPR** | EU | Data minimization for KYC data, right to erasure vs retention obligations |
| **MiFID II / PSD2** | EU | Client categorization, payment service provider due diligence |

**Key tension:** AML retention requirements (5-7 years) vs GDPR data minimization — the spec must address this.

## Typical Business Rules

These are **suggestions** — confirm with the user and adapt to their specific institution.

| Rule | Condition | Action | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **CDD Tier Assignment** | All new customers | Assign risk tier: Simplified (SDD), Standard (CDD), Enhanced (EDD) based on risk factors | Risk factors: geography, product type, transaction patterns, PEP status |
| **PEP Screening** | All customers | Screen against PEP lists (domestic + foreign) | Must include family members and close associates |
| **Sanctions Screening** | All customers + all transactions | Screen against OFAC SDN, EU sanctions, UN sanctions | Real-time for transactions, periodic refresh for customers |
| **Beneficial Ownership** | Entity customers (non-individual) | Identify all beneficial owners with ≥25% ownership | Threshold varies by jurisdiction (10% in some EU states) |
| **EDD Trigger** | High-risk country, PEP, complex ownership, unusual activity | Escalate to Enhanced Due Diligence; the agent's output must name the matched PEP or related party and the relationship (e.g. beneficial owner, director, family member) that triggered EDD | Requires senior approval, additional documentation |
| **Periodic Review** | All active customers | Re-verify KYC at intervals: High=1yr, Medium=3yr, Low=5yr | Triggered also by material change events |
| **SAR Filing** | Suspicious activity detected | File Suspicious Activity Report within 30 days | Cannot notify the customer (tipping off prohibition) |
| **CTR Filing** | Cash transaction ≥ $10,000 | File Currency Transaction Report | Structuring detection for split transactions |
| **Document Expiry** | ID document expiration date passed | Flag for re-verification, block high-risk transactions | Grace period varies by risk tier |

## Typical Process Patterns

### New Customer Onboarding (CDD Flow)
```
Application intake → Identity verification → PEP screening → Sanctions screening
    → Risk scoring → Tier assignment → [If EDD needed → Enhanced review → Approval]
    → Account activation → Schedule periodic review
```

### Periodic Review
```
Review trigger (timer or event) → Refresh customer data → Re-screen sanctions/PEP
    → Recalculate risk → [If risk increased → Trigger EDD]
    → Update review date → Schedule next review
```

### Suspicious Activity Investigation
```
Alert received → Gather transaction history → Analyze patterns
    → [If suspicious → Draft SAR → Compliance review → File SAR]
    → [If cleared → Document rationale → Close alert]
```
