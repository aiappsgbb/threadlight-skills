# Brand Palettes — Sector Convention Fallback Table

> **Read this first.** This table is a **fallback**, not a substitute for the
> customer's actual brand guidelines. When `customer.brand_palette.primary`
> is captured during discovery (SPEC § 1) OR the customer's logo URL is
> available for live colour sampling, use those first. Reach for this table
> only when neither is available AND the sector convention is so strong
> ("they're red like the well-known UK telco") that a defensible default
> beats a guess.
>
> Every row carries a **citation** so the seller can defend the choice in
> the call. The hex codes are drawn from the brand's own public guidelines
> or from the sector's universally-recognised primary. They are **not**
> trademarked use — they're inputs to a brand-flood substrate behind a
> Microsoft × {Customer} co-brand bar.

## How this table is consumed

Cross-cutting Pattern 1 (Brand Cascade) detection order:

1. **Explicit** — `SPEC § 1 → customer.brand_palette.{primary, secondary, tertiary}` set during discovery
2. **Logo URL** — fetch + sample dominant non-neutral hex (offline if possible)
3. **This table** — sector convention lookup by `domain + customer name`
4. **Neutral fallback** — slate grey palette (no brand) + amber accent — only when none of 1-3 apply

When this table is the source, the generator MUST annotate the SPEC § 13
assumptions block:

```yaml
brand_palette_source: convention-fallback
brand_palette_cited: "see references/brand-palettes.md → <Sector> · <Brand>"
brand_palette_confirmed: false   # set true when customer confirms in next call
```

## Seeded sector conventions

> **Format:** `Sector · Brand → Primary (hex) · Secondary (hex) — citation`
>
> **Coverage rule:** when a new pilot uses a customer not on this list, add
> a row in the same shape. Keep this table to ≤30 rows long — beyond that,
> spin out a per-sector child file (e.g. `brand-palettes-fsi.md`).

## What to do when the customer is not on this list

1. **Try the logo URL first.** Most companies publish a brand portal or
   styleguide PDF. A 60-second search usually yields a defensible primary
   hex.
2. **Check the sector convention.** If the customer is a regional bank, a
   tier-2 telco, or a sector player, the sector primary (e.g. Mastercard
   red for card networks, NHS blue for UK healthcare delivery) is usually
   acceptable as a stand-in until they confirm.
3. **Use the neutral fallback.** If nothing is defensible, use the
   threadlight default slate-grey palette (`#1F2937` primary, `#F59E0B`
   amber accent). Annotate `brand_palette_source: neutral-fallback` in
   SPEC § 13 so the next iteration replaces it.
4. **Never invent.** Do not pick a colour because "it looks nice for a
   utility". The seller has to defend every visual choice — undocumented
   palettes turn into trust debt in the first call.

## Citations note

Brand portal URLs change. The intent of the citation column is to record
**where the hex came from at time of seeding**, not to maintain a live
link. When updating a row, replace the citation; do not chain
citation-of-citation.
