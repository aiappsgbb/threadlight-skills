# `demo-deck.html` — Cinematic Talk Deck

> **Read this first**: this document is **NOT a template**. It's a **kit of
> parts** for building a single-file cinematic talk deck tailored to ONE live
> customer moment. Reusing the same 10–14 slides for every PoC is the fastest
> way to make a room feel cheap, generic, and AI-generated. The grammar is
> stable. The copy, numbers, and emphasis are bespoke.

`demo-deck.html` is the **LIVE TALK artifact**: keyboard-paced, full-screen,
and designed to be spoken over in **≤ 8 minutes**. It is **NOT** a brief. It is
**NOT** a dossier. It is **NOT** a crib sheet. It **REPLACES** `overview.html`,
because `overview.html` turned out to be the wrong shape for a live customer
moment.

> **Primary customer-facing artifact.** If a threadlight PoC is demoable, this
> is the thing the customer should remember. `overview.html`, `experience.html`,
> `prep-guide.html`, and `SPEC.md` support it; they do not outrank it in the
> room.

## When to generate

- Any threadlight PoC with `internal-no-demo: false` (the default). **Mandatory.**
- Any workshop, exec readout, or seller-led meeting where someone will
  full-screen the browser and talk over it.
- Any PoC that needs a clean replacement for legacy `overview.html`.

Skip only when:

- `internal-no-demo: true`
- The artefact is strictly internal and no live customer moment exists
- A separate instruction explicitly says “no deck”

## The 10–14 slide grammar

Think in **grammar**, not recipe. The reference deck v4 that finally stuck landed at
12 slides because it split the live handoff into a cue slide plus a pure-black
holding slide. Reference deck v8 then added a preview-answer insurance slide and a
hub-spoke architecture slide. Most PoCs still land at 11 or 12. Ten is
acceptable only when one conditional slide is collapsed into its neighbor.

> **Kit of parts, not a recipe.** The row order below is the stable grammar.
> The exact copy, numbers, reveals, and emphasis come from the SPEC, AGENTS.md,
> and the actual live path you intend to show.

| # | Slide type | Status | Purpose | SPEC clauses that activate it | Recommended length | Recommended reveals | What NOT to put on it |
|---|------------|--------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | Cold-open | **Mandatory** | Brandmark + journey name + headline. Silence the room fast. A dark cinematic hero **or** a brand-flood hero are both valid. | Every deck; pull customer name, journey name, and the sharpest claim from `SPEC § 1`. | 1 headline + optional 1 support line; ~15–25 seconds. | 2 states max; dark hero with brand-accent gradient is valid. | No paragraphs, architecture, dates, seller names, or licensed logo. |
| 2 | Context | **Conditional** | Restate the customer's stated goal so the deck feels anchored to the brief. | `SPEC § 1` goal / problem statement / mission. | 1 quote, contrast, or 2-panel setup; ~20–30 seconds. | 2–4 reveals. | No personas. No platform diagram. |
| 3 | Friction | **Conditional** | Quantify the current-state tax with **3 numeric pain points**. This is one of the mandatory brand-flood panels. | `SPEC § 3` business rules, pain-point logs, current-state constraints. | 3 numbers + 1 foot line; ~30–40 seconds. | 3–6 reveals. | No invented stats. No anecdotal persona scene. |
| 4 | The shift | **Conditional** | Show before / after, today / from now, or current / target state. Optional place to spend the fourth brand-flood panel if the story needs lift. | `SPEC § 9` functional success criteria. | 2–3 cards or panels; ~25–40 seconds. | 3–6 reveals. | No roadmap promises. No delivery plan. |
| 5 | Live-demo cue | **Mandatory** | Hand the room from talk track to the live invocation: “Now let's watch.” | Any PoC with `internal-no-demo: false` and a real demo path. | 1 short cue; split into cue + pure-black holding card only if you need clean alt-tab time. | 1–3 reveals. | No screenshots, setup monologue, or hard sell. |
| 6 | Skill chain | **Mandatory** | Decode what just happened into an exact tool sequence. | `AGENTS.md` **Foundry tools required** + `SPEC § 6` tool contracts. | 1 chain + 3–4 callouts; ~30–45 seconds. | Reveal chain in groups, callouts last. | No invented tool names, pseudo-tools, or raw transport labels. |
| 7 | Platform stack | **Mandatory** | Show the 6-layer cake that makes the demo credible. | Architecture / deployment clauses, surfaces, tools, memory, and observability sections. | 6 layers, read top-down; ~30–45 seconds. | 4–6 reveals. | No bare-text pills. No vendor soup. |
| 8 | Scale | **Conditional** | Prove this is a pattern, not a one-off. Use **3 numeric horizons**. Optional place to spend the fourth brand-flood panel. | Scale targets, nonfunctional sections, phased posture, future-state clauses. | 3 horizon blocks; ~25–35 seconds. | 3–6 reveals. | No effort estimate or firm dates. |
| 9 | Posture | **Conditional** | Rhythm break: light-inverse governance / trust posture slide. Optional place to spend the fourth brand-flood panel if you need more heat before the close. | `SPEC § 11` governance posture and hard guardrails. | 4–6 pills; ~20–30 seconds. | 3–6 reveals. | No policy essay or legal wall of text. |
| 10 | Follow-up proposal | **Mandatory** | Put 3 concrete next steps on the table so the room has something specific to react to. This is one of the mandatory brand-flood panels. | Every external demo; pull the steps from the strongest post-demo technical path. | 3 steps max, then stop talking. | 3–5 reveals. | No delivery commitment, dates, effort, or “pick one journey.” |
| 11 | Close | **Mandatory** | Bookend the open: brandmark echo + “Thank you.” + Microsoft × Customer co-brand bar. This is one of the mandatory brand-flood panels. | Every deck. | 1 beat; ~5–10 seconds. | 2–3 reveals. | No seller names, emails, phone numbers, or CTA. |

Practical packaging rules:

- **11 slides** is the default shape.
- **12–14 slides** are acceptable when the Preview answer, Architecture, and/or
  the row-5 cue split earn their keep.
- **10 slides** is acceptable only when one conditional slide is merged into an
  adjacent conditional slide. Never drop rows **1, 5, 6, 7, 10, or 11**.

> Dark hero with brand-accent gradient is a valid cinematic opening (the
> reference deck uses this). Brand-flood panels must still hit **≥ 4 total**:
> **friction + follow-up proposal + close** are mandatory, plus at least one
> more chosen from **hero, the shift, scale, or posture**.

---

## Preview answer slide (visual insurance)

**When to use.** Conditional but recommended when there's a live demo. Put it
between **The shift** (slide 4) and the **Live-demo cue** (slide 5/6).

**Purpose.** Show what a real answer looks like **before** the live demo. If
the demo wobbles, flip back to this slide.

**Structure**
- `.preview-panel` — dark background, rounded corners, visible border.
- `.preview-q` — italic question.
- `.preview-a` — answer body with `<strong>` highlights.
- `.preview-cite` — citation block with a `.pill` version badge + source
  reference.
- Footer line: `Citation. Version. Source page. Every time — not sometimes.`

**Speaker note guidance.** “This sets the audience's expectation. If the live
demo wobbles later, they've already seen a real answer.”

## CSS token table

The deck works because a small set of tokens does a lot of work: **brand flood**,
**neutral dark**, **one light inverse**, **one safe brandmark**, and **one
consistent chrome system**.

### Root tokens (verbatim from reference deck)
```css
    :root {
      /* === Brand-aligned palette (reference example — swap to customer brand) === */
      --brand-primary: #E60000;
      --brand-bright:  #FF2A2A;
      --brand-dark:    #A00000;
      --brand-deep:    #4d0606;
      --bg-0:          #0A0A0A;
      --bg-1:          #141414;
      --bg-2:          #1F1F1F;
      --light-bg:      #FAFAFA;
      --light-bg-2:    #F1F1F1;
      --text:          #FFFFFF;
      --text-dark:     #0A0A0A;
      --muted:         #B3B3B3;
      --muted-dark:    #5C5C5C;
      --line:          rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
      --line-dark:     rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.12);

      /* MS corporate quadrant (logo only) */
      --ms-orange: #F25022;
      --ms-green:  #7FBA00;
      --ms-blue:   #00A4EF;
      --ms-yellow: #FFB900;

      --display: "Inter", "SF Pro Display", "Segoe UI", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
      --mono:    "JetBrains Mono", "SF Mono", "Cascadia Mono", Consolas, "Liberation Mono", monospace;
      --ease:     cubic-bezier(.21, .61, .35, 1);
      --ease-out: cubic-bezier(.16, 1, .3, 1);
    }
```

These are the canonical reference root tokens. Swap only the brand hex
values for your pilot; keep the **roles** stable so the rest of the deck
CSS continues to work unchanged.

| Token | Reference value | Role | Use in the deck |
|-------|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `--brand-primary` | `#E60000` | Primary brand | Primary brand flood, glyph accent, progress bar start. |
| `--brand-bright` | `#FF2A2A` | Highlight | Highlight edge, reveal emphasis, progress bar end. |
| `--brand-dark` | `#A00000` | Deeper brand | Gradient shadow edge, deeper flood base. |
| `--brand-deep` | `#4d0606` | Darkest brand | Darkest brand field. |
| `--bg-0` | `#0A0A0A` | `--deck-black` | Global dark substrate. |
| `--bg-1` | `#141414` | `--deck-charcoal` | Dark gradient top / neutral panel lift. |
| `--bg-2` | `#1F1F1F` | `--deck-charcoal-2` | Optional secondary dark stop. |
| `--light-bg` | `#FAFAFA` | `--deck-paper` | Light-inverse posture / shift slides. |
| `--light-bg-2` | `#F1F1F1` | `--deck-paper-2` | Gradient tail for the light slide. |
| `--text` | `#FFFFFF` | `--text-light` | Default dark-slide text. |
| `--text-dark` | `#0A0A0A` | `--text-dark` | Default light-slide text. |
| `--muted` | `#B3B3B3` | `--muted-light` | Secondary copy on dark slides. |
| `--muted-dark` | `#5C5C5C` | `--muted-dark` | Secondary copy on light slides. |
| `--line` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12)` | `--line-light` | Dark-slide dividers and borders. |
| `--line-dark` | `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.12)` | `--line-dark` | Light-slide borders and pill outlines. |
| `--ms-orange` | `#F25022` | Microsoft quadrant | MS logo only. |
| `--ms-green` | `#7FBA00` | Microsoft quadrant | MS logo only. |
| `--ms-blue` | `#00A4EF` | Microsoft quadrant | MS logo only. |
| `--ms-yellow` | `#FFB900` | Microsoft quadrant | MS logo only. |
| `--display` | `Inter` stack | Display font stack | Headlines and deck-wide sans. |
| `--mono` | `JetBrains Mono` stack | Monospace font stack | Tool names, counters, HUD, labels. |
| `--ease` | `cubic-bezier(.21, .61, .35, 1)` | Standard ease | Slide opacity / UI chrome movement. |
| `--ease-out` | `cubic-bezier(.16, 1, .3, 1)` | Snappier ease-out | Reveals and scale-in transitions. |

Map the brand quartet explicitly:
```css
:root {
  --brand-primary: #E60000;   /* swap to customer's primary brand colour */
  --brand-bright:  #FF2A2A;
  --brand-dark:    #A00000;
  --brand-deep:    #4d0606;
}
```

## Visual density constraints

The slide grammar and CSS tokens define **what** each slide contains. These
density rules define **how much** — they are the guardrails that prevent a
structurally correct deck from being visually broken.

> **Battle-scar source.** A recent commercial-sales PoC (May 2026) — the
> sub-agent produced an 11-slide deck that passed every automated gate
> (correct slide count, speaker notes 1:1, brand-flood panels ≥ 4, tool
> names canonical, zero banned phrases) but was **visually unusable**:
> overlapping two-column grids, walls of text in tiny cards, no breathing
> room. The rebuild that landed was 334 lines instead of 1,677.

**Per-slide rules:**

| Rule | Constraint | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Headlines | Max **1 H2** per slide (never two H2s on one slide) | Two headlines fight for attention at projection distance |
| Subtitle | Max **1** `<p class="sub">` per slide | Second paragraphs never get read |
| Cards per row | Max **3** (use `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)`) | 4+ cards at 1440px become illegibly narrow |
| Card body text | Max **2 lines** — title + one sentence | More text makes every card look the same = no hierarchy |
| Speaker notes | Max **3 sentences** in imperative voice | Sellers skim notes; verbose meta-explanations get ignored |
| Big numbers | At least **1 oversized typographic element** per slide that reads at 3m | Numbers, short words, or symbols — the visual anchor |
| Frame padding | Min **clamp(32px, 4vw, 56px)** | Below 28px the content feels trapped |
| Card padding | Min **28px** | Tight cards lose their border breathing room |

**Layout rules:**

| Pattern | When to use | When NOT to use |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Single column | Text-heavy slides (context, scale, posture) | Never force text-heavy content into 2-col |
| 2-column | Before/after pairs, number + context (e.g. `<30s` beside explanation) | Not for two independent text blocks |
| 3-column grid | Pain cards, option cards, scale horizons | Not for cards with > 2 lines of body text |
| Pill grid (3×N) | Tool names, governance items — information-dense but low-text | Not for detailed descriptions |

**Anti-patterns (fail the visual review):**

- Two-column layout where both columns have > 3 lines of text each
- Cards with `min-height` that forces whitespace gaps when content is short
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` at 1440px with body text in each card
- Slide with more than 6 distinct UI elements competing for attention
- Layer cake where every layer has a full sentence description (keep to title + short phrase)

### Structural hooks

| Hook | What it does | Canonical guidance |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| `.bg-{brand}-flood` | Full-bleed brand panel | Use for the slides that need pressure or bookend force. Think hero / friction / follow-up proposal / close. |
| `.bg-light` | Light-inverse rhythm break | Use once, maybe twice. It should feel like a breath, not a second theme. |
| `.reveal.d1` … `.reveal.d6` | Staged entrance classes | Reference deck uses 0.08–0.84s delays. Tune to the brand, but keep it human. |
| `data-states="N"` | Per-slide sub-state machine | Lets one slide advance through N reveal states before the controller moves on. |
| `.cobrand` | Hero / follow-up top chrome | Always Microsoft × Customer. Right-hand label stays anonymous. |
| `.brandmark` | Safe customer logo substitute | Monogram + white circle + brand flood card. |
| `.layer .tech` + `.ico` | Platform stack pill grammar | Every pill gets an icon prefix. Bare text pills look unfinished. |
| `.preview-panel` / `.preview-q` / `.preview-a` / `.preview-cite` | Visual-insurance answer shell | Use before a live demo to show the citation pattern the room should expect. |
| `.arch-diagram` / `.arch-hub` / `.arch-connector` / `.arch-spoke` | Hub-spoke architecture frame | Left hub, vertical access-contract connector, right pilot spoke. |
| `.arch-gov-row` / `.arch-gov-card` / `.gov-link` | Governance card strip | 3 equal cards under the diagram, each with an explicit repo link. |
| `.discussion-row` + `.discussion-card` | 3-card closing layout | Reuse for follow-up proposal steps (or legacy discussion prompts). Equal weight. |
| `.close-brandmark` / `.close-thanks` / `.close-cobrand-block` / `.close-stack` / `.slide.is-center` | Final-slide bookend system | Keep the close sparse, centered, and anonymous. |
| `.note` + `[data-for="N"]` | Speaker notes mapping | Exactly one note per slide. `data-for` must equal slide index. |

Canonical background + reveal pattern:
```css

.bg-red-flood::before {
  content: ""; position: absolute; inset: 0; z-index: -1;
  background:
    radial-gradient(1400px 800px at 50% 40%, rgba(255, 50, 50, 0.18), transparent 60%),
    linear-gradient(135deg, var(--brand-primary) 0%, var(--brand-dark) 100%);
}
.bg-light::before {
  content: ""; position: absolute; inset: 0; z-index: -1;
  background:
    radial-gradient(900px 500px at 20% 18%, rgba(230, 0, 0, 0.06), transparent 60%),
    linear-gradient(180deg, var(--light-bg) 0%, var(--light-bg-2) 100%);
}
.reveal { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(24px); transition: opacity .7s var(--ease-out), transform .8s var(--ease-out); }
.slide.is-active .reveal.in { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
.reveal.d1 { transition-delay: 0.08s; }
.reveal.d2 { transition-delay: 0.20s; }
.reveal.d3 { transition-delay: 0.34s; }
.reveal.d4 { transition-delay: 0.50s; }
.reveal.d5 { transition-delay: 0.66s; }
.reveal.d6 { transition-delay: 0.84s; }
```

Sub-state example:
```html
<section class="slide is-active bg-dark" data-states="2">
  <div class="brandmark reveal d1">…</div>
  <h1 class="display reveal d2">…</h1>
  <p class="lead reveal d3 state-2">This line appears on the second Space press.</p>
</section>
```

## JS controller pattern

Keep the controller tiny, deterministic, and **slide-count agnostic**. The reference
deck works because the script does **not** hard-code a slide total; it asks the
DOM how many slides exist, then updates the counter, notes, and progress bar
from that.

### Keyboard map

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` / `→` / `PageDown` | Advance slide or sub-state |
| `←` / `PageUp` | Go back one slide or sub-state |
| `F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `S` | Toggle speaker notes |
| `B` / `.` | Toggle blackout |
| `0–9` | Jump directly (`0` means slide 10) |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to first / last slide |
| Click stage | Advance |

### Canonical controller (extracted from reference deck)
```js
  (function () {
    var stage = document.getElementById('stage');
    var slides = Array.prototype.slice.call(stage.querySelectorAll('.slide'));
    var notes = document.querySelectorAll('.notes .note');
    var notesIdx = document.getElementById('notes-idx');
    var curEl = document.getElementById('cur');
    var totEl = document.getElementById('tot');
    var progress = document.getElementById('progress');
    var body = document.body;

    var current = 0;
    var subState = 1;
    var max = slides.length;
    totEl.textContent = String(max).padStart(2, '0');

    function maxStateOf(idx) {
      var d = slides[idx].getAttribute('data-states');
      return d ? parseInt(d, 10) : 1;
    }

      idleTimer = setTimeout(function () {
        body.classList.add('idle');
        body.classList.remove('active');
      }, 2500);
    }
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', activity);
    document.addEventListener('keydown', activity);
    activity();
  })();
```

What this controller guarantees:

- `slides.length` auto-derives total count, so the HUD stays honest.
- `current` + `subState` form a simple, reliable state machine.
- `data-states="N"` lets Space step through reveal states before the next slide.
- The progress bar updates on every render.
- Notes are a strict 1:1 mapping: `.note[data-for="N"]` ↔ slide `N`.
- `sessionStorage` remembers the current slide if the presenter refreshes.

### Speaker note voice rules

Speaker notes are read aloud by sellers — often nervously, 15 minutes
before the call. They must sound like coaching, not documentation.

**Voice:** Imperative, direct, second-person.

| ✅ Good | ❌ Bad |
|---------|--------|
| "Open with tension: declining category, four fragmented systems." | "This slide anchors the conversation in the customer's operating reality." |
| "Land on the <30s number — that's the metric to remember." | "The KPI matters because it converts an abstract AI story into a measurable business shift." |
| "Let the pain build: fragmentation → effort → missed windows." | "Use the reveals to let the pain build in a commercial sequence." |

**Rules:**
- Max **3 sentences** per note
- First sentence = what to say or do
- Include **one concrete number or entity** from the SPEC (not generic)
- Never start with "This slide..." or "The point of..."
- Never use the word "emphasise" — just write what to say

## Brandmark substitute recipe

When the customer's licensed logo is unavailable — which is **most PoCs** — use
a safe substitute, not a bootleg logo.

### Option A — Monogram substitute

1. Start from the customer display name.
2. Strip legal suffixes and filler words (`Ltd`, `plc`, `Group`, `Holdings`,
   `The`) unless they are part of the brand.
3. Extract a **2-letter monogram** from the first meaningful words or the
   customer's established acronym.
4. Render it as `.brandmark` with a **white circle glyph** on the brand-flood
   panel.
5. Use a heavy sans (`Inter 800` or system sans-bold).
6. Echo the same mark on slide 1 and the final slide only.

Example:
```html
<span class="brandmark">
  <span class="glyph">XX</span>
  <span class="word">Customer-Journey Advisor</span>
</span>
```

Notes:

- A 24–32px white circle is the safe floor if you tighten the composition.
- The point is **recognizable authorship without trademark risk**.
- **Never** use the customer's actual licensed logo without explicit permission.

### Option B — Live-linked customer logo (when publicly hosted)

When the customer's logo is available on their public website and the
presentation will have internet access, link it directly with an offline
fallback:

```html
<div class="brandmark">
  <img src="https://customer.com/path/to/logo.png"
       alt="Customer Name"
       style="width:68%;height:auto;object-fit:contain"
       onerror="this.outerHTML='XX'">
</div>
```

- `onerror` falls back to the monogram if offline or image fails
- Works in all browsers including `file://` protocol (shows monogram)
- **Never** download, trace, or recreate the logo as an SVG path — that's
  copyright infringement regardless of intent
- Document the source URL in SPEC § 13 assumptions:
  `brand_logo_source: https://customer.com/path/to/logo.png`

**Battle-scar.** A recent PoC attempted to recreate the logo as an
inline SVG path (produced an unrecognizable arrow shape), then tried the
monogram (too generic for a FTSE 100 customer). The live-linked `<img>`
with `onerror` fallback was the right answer.

## Microsoft 4-color SVG (canonical)

Do not redraw this. Copy-paste the literal inline SVG.
```html

<svg class="ms-logo" viewBox="0 0 23 23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Microsoft">
  <rect x="1" y="1" width="10" height="10" fill="#F25022"/>
  <rect x="12" y="1" width="10" height="10" fill="#7FBA00"/>
  <rect x="1" y="12" width="10" height="10" fill="#00A4EF"/>
  <rect x="12" y="12" width="10" height="10" fill="#FFB900"/>
</svg>
```

Co-brand bar pattern:
```html

<div class="cobrand">
  <div class="left">
    <svg class="ms-logo" viewBox="0 0 23 23" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Microsoft">
      <rect x="1" y="1" width="10" height="10" fill="#F25022"/>
      <rect x="12" y="1" width="10" height="10" fill="#7FBA00"/>
      <rect x="1" y="12" width="10" height="10" fill="#00A4EF"/>
      <rect x="12" y="12" width="10" height="10" fill="#FFB900"/>
    </svg>
    <span class="ms-word">Microsoft</span>
    <span class="x">×</span>
    <span class="ms-word" style="color:#FFFFFF;">{Customer}</span>
  </div>
  <div class="right">{Context label · Month Year}</div>
</div>
```

## Tech-stack icon library (18 inline symbols)

The platform and architecture slides only look finished when the pills and
cards carry **real inline symbols**. Bare text pills read like placeholder UI.
The reference deck solved this with a single hidden SVG sprite at the top of the body.

> **Copy the whole sprite block once.** Do not rename the symbol IDs. Do not
> swap them for emoji. Do not mix in random third-party icon packs.

### Emoji fallback (acceptable in specific contexts)

The 18-symbol SVG sprite library remains the **default** for tech pills on
the Platform stack and Architecture slides — monochrome line icons at 18px
read clean and professional.

However, **emoji are acceptable** in these contexts:

- **Layer cake icons** — the stacked layers read better with emoji at
  projection distance (💬 📊 🤖 📚 ⚙️ 🔒) because the color provides
  instant differentiation that monochrome line icons lack
- **Governance pills** — emoji shields, clocks, and locks carry enough
  meaning without needing the full sprite library
- **Decorative context** — any element where the icon adds visual rhythm
  but isn't the primary information carrier

**Never:**
- Mix SVG sprites and emoji **on the same slide**
- Use emoji on the Skill Chain slide (tool names need the professional
  SVG treatment)
- Use emoji where the icon disambiguates meaning (e.g., distinguishing
  "AI Search" from "Cosmos DB" — use `#ico-search` vs `#ico-globe`)

Architecture icon purposes:

| Symbol | Meaning | Typical placement |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `ico-gateway` | APIM AI Gateway, API management | Architecture hub block |
| `ico-policy` | Policy guard, governance shield | AGT governance card, agent runtime layer |
| `ico-telemetry` | Observability, telemetry | Observability platform layer, hub block |
| `ico-hub` | Hub-spoke topology | Architecture spoke `× 400 spokes` line |

Canonical pill markup:
```html
<span class="tech"><svg class="ico"><use href="#ico-window"/></svg>Workspace</span>
```

---

## Architecture slide (hub-spoke + governance)

**When to use.** Conditional — include when the SPEC has explicit governance
posture or scale targets. It sits after the **Platform stack** slide and before
the **Follow-up proposal**.

**Structure (3 panels)**
- **Hub block (left)** — title `AI Citadel · Governance Hub` (or the
  customer-specific governance brand). Each row uses **Feature → Service**
  format:
  - `LLM governance → Azure API Management (AI Gateway)`
  - `Policy mesh → APIM policy fragments + JWT auth`
  - `Usage tracking → Azure Cosmos DB`
  - `Observability → App Insights + Log Analytics (OTel)`
  - `Network isolation → Private endpoints + VNet + DNS`
- **Connector** — vertical line with `Access contract` label
  (`writing-mode: vertical`).
- **Spoke block (right)** — title `Journey spoke · this pilot`. List the
  pilot's services (Foundry, AI Search, MCP, Cosmos). Final row:
  `× N spokes — same pattern, same hub`.
- **Governance cards (below, 3-col)** — each card has a name, 2-line
  description, and repo link. Standard cards:
  - `AI Citadel` → `Azure-Samples/ai-hub-gateway-solution-accelerator`
  - `AGT` → `microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit`
  - `Foundry` → `ai.azure.com`

**CSS classes**
- `.arch-diagram` — 3-column grid: hub | connector | spoke
- `.arch-hub`
- `.arch-spoke`
- `.arch-connector`
- `.arch-gov-row` — 3-column grid
- `.arch-gov-card`
- `.gov-link` — clickable repo links

---

## Follow-up proposal slide (replaces Discussion)

**Why.** The old Discussion slide with 3 open questions felt pointless after a
strong technical demo. A concrete follow-up proposal gives the audience
something to react to.

**Structure**
- Reuse `.discussion-row` + `.discussion-card`.
- Use `<span class="qnum">Step 01</span>` / `Step 02` / `Step 03` labels —
  not `Question`.
- Make each card a concrete action:
  - `Pick 5 high-friction journeys`
  - `Deploy AI Citadel hub`
  - `Governance + eval baseline`

**Speaker note guidance.** “Read each step as a concrete proposal, not a wish.
These are options on the table, not commitments.”

**Brand note.** This is still one of the mandatory brand-flood panels.

---

## Migration: legacy `overview.html` → meta-refresh redirect

When upgrading an existing PoC, do **not** leave the old brief pretending to be
the live deck. Collapse it to a tiny redirect and archive the old content.

1. Move the previous file to `overview.html.bak`.
2. Replace `overview.html` with this redirect shell.
3. Add `specs/*.html.bak` to `.gitignore`.

Redirect shell:
```html

<!doctype html><html><head><meta charset="utf-8">
<title>{Customer-Journey Advisor} — redirecting</title>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=demo-deck.html">
<script>location.replace('demo-deck.html');</script>
</head><body><p>This page has moved to <a href="demo-deck.html">demo-deck.html</a>.</p></body></html>
```

`.gitignore` addition:
```gitignore
specs/*.html.bak
```

### AGENTS.md § Tool display aliases (optional)

The **canonical name** is whatever appears in `AGENTS.md` **Foundry tools required**
column 1. Period. If the wire-level MCP transport name is uglier
(`customer-kb__mcp__search`) but the runtime alias is `customer_kb`, the
alias wins for deck copy — that is what ships in the runtime and what the user
actually types or says.

If a tool needs a shorter display label for the deck, add an explicit
`AGENTS.md § Tool display aliases` block. Pattern 6 then treats those aliases as
canonical **in addition to** the column-1 names.

```md
| Canonical | Display alias |
|---|---|
| customer_kb | Journey KB |
| customer_get_account | Account lookup |
```

---

## "Reasons a deck gets rejected" — anti-pattern list

These are not hypothetical. They are the exact classes of mistake that caused
multiple rejected deck drafts before the reference v4 form stuck.

1. **Personas in the deck** — “I EXPLICITLY ASKED TO NOT BUG ME ABOUT USER PERSONA!”
   Personas live in `experience.html`, **not** the deck. Use roles, not names.
2. **Internal jargon leaks** — `OneAsk`, `Sweden Central`, `v1.0`, seller names,
   and contact details are forbidden in customer-facing slides. `prep-guide.html`
   is exempt because it is internal-only.
3. **Fabricated tool names** — do **not** invent `load_skill`-style labels. The
   visible tool-name set on the Skill Chain slide must be a subset of the names
   in `AGENTS.md` **Foundry tools required** column 1, **or** aliases explicitly
   documented in `AGENTS.md § Tool display aliases`. Raw wire-level transport
   names do not belong on the deck.
4. **Wrong palette / third-color accents** — a red telco deck does not need
   cobalt, amber, or purple flourishes. Brand should flood panels, not just
   underline headings.
5. **Commit-language closing** — never end with “we'll build”, “by 12 June”, or
   any other commit phrase. The close pair is **Follow-up proposal + Thank you**.
6. **Missing tech-stack icons** — bare text pills make the Platform and
   Architecture slides look unfinished. Use the 18-symbol inline library.
7. **Contributor signoff on the closing slide** — never put an individual seller
   name, email, or role signoff on the final customer-facing slide.
8. **Sales-close ending** — “Pick one journey by {date}” is not a deck ending.
   The deck should reopen the conversation, not close the deal.

## Validation gates (must pass before declaring done)

Run all of these. **ALL must pass.**

```text
- HTMLParser parses with zero errors
- 10–14 <section class="slide"> elements
- Speaker notes count == slide count (1:1 data-for mapping)
- All 4 keyboard chords wired (Space / F / S / B)
- Brand-flood panels ≥ 4 total: friction + follow-up proposal + close are
  mandatory, plus at least 1 of {hero, the-shift, scale, posture}
- Dark hero with brand-accent gradient is valid (the reference deck uses this)
- Brandmark substitute present on slide 1 AND final slide
- MS co-brand bar present on hero AND close
- 18-symbol icon library present; the core 14 platform symbols must be
  referenced via <use href="#ico-XXX">, and the 4 architecture symbols must be
  referenced when the Architecture slide is present
- ZERO hits for internal-jargon deny-list
- ZERO hits for persona first-names
- Tool-name set in deck ⊆ AGENTS.md canonical tool/alias set
- ZERO hits for banned-phrase deny-list ("we'll build", near-term commitment dates, etc.)
- Playwright sanity at 1920×1080: Space advances, S toggles notes, F goes fullscreen,
  B blacks out, Home/End jump correctly
```

### Manual / browser checks

- At **1920×1080**, verify `Space`, `S`, `F`, `B`, `Home`, and `End`.
- Notes overlay should track the current slide 1:1.
- Progress bar should move on every slide change.
- Expand the persona deny-list with any first-names used in sibling artefacts,
  then rerun grep.
- Treat any explicit customer-facing delivery date as a fail unless the slide is
  discussing a historical fact.
